Rampa TV guest is Jack Chidarelli,
Republican candidate for the governor of
New Jersey. Hello.
&gt;&gt; Hello, Monica. You nailed my last name.
My compliments.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much. We are here and I
want to thank you&#39;re having us here in
your um office. Of course, the campaign
is at its last week and it&#39;s very
heated. So, I want to thank you for your
time and this is a big nod also to
Polish American community. That&#39;s a big
part of this state.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Um so I want to start off with this. Um
how do you see working with Polish
American community? Do you have any
goals for that community in this state?
Uh and of course also coming from
immigrant family. Um how you look at
this new generation of Polish Americans.
&gt;&gt; The goal for the Polish American
community in New Jersey is the same goal
I have for every minority community. And
that&#39;s to make sure people feel
confident that New Jersey is where they
can achieve their American dream. Uh
unfortunately today people not so
confident. Uh more than half of New
Jerseyians feel the state is heading the
wrong direction. Two out of three are
looking to leave. Uh people have lost
faith in the public school system. Uh
whether they get the job of their dreams
here, start a business here, raise a
middle class family here, retire here.
&gt;&gt; These are all the things that people
feel a bit insecure about if not fearful
of today. And it&#39;s one of the primary
reasons why I&#39;m running. I believe
leadership matters. We can fix all that.
And since I mentioned that and we
started off this, you&#39;re coming from
immigrant family yourself generation
let&#39;s say ago. But uh how does this
experience also shape your view of
public service? Because I feel like uh
this is a mission. It&#39;s more than a job.
&gt;&gt; It is a mission. And uh because I love
New Jersey, it&#39;s been very very good to
three generations of Chedarellis. What&#39;s
different today is my parents felt
confident they could get ahead as
members of the middle class and have
somewhat comfortable life because of
their hard work and that their children
were going to do better than them. They
never had to worry about me walking to
the bus stop. They didn&#39;t have to worry
about what I was learning in school that
day. And um so again, these are all the
things that people don&#39;t feel so
confident about these days. And it&#39;s uh
what I want to fix as governor.
Leadership matters.
&gt;&gt; When uh of course in your lifetime you
did uh many important things. Let me let
me just sum it up this way because we
want to get to the point. But um you
were also a business owner and uh
running before I know you had big plans
for small business owners as well. Being
a business owner yourself, how do you
see u what&#39;s most needed for business
right now? And what would be your first
step? Because right now New Jersey is
ranked one of the worst states to have a
business, very unfriendly taxes, fees.
So what would be your first step in this
direction? Yeah, certainly the most
important thing I&#39;ve done in my life.
Melinda and I did a very good job
raising our four kids. Um, and so
they&#39;re now all very self-sufficient,
responsible adults. Uh, but you&#39;re
right. One of my primary motivations and
objectives in serving as governor, make
New Jersey a better place to do
business. We&#39;re always ranked as one of
the worst places in the country to do
business because of taxes, because of
regulations. Look at your electricity
bills these days. And so those are all
things that we could change. And I know
firsthand, not only as a CPA who&#39;s very,
very familiar with our tax code and our
regulations, but as somebody who&#39;s owned
a business twice over, two-time
successful business owner who&#39;s created
jobs for fellow New Jerseyians. So,
let&#39;s make the first $100,000 of
business income taxfree for a small
business. Let&#39;s make the first $100,000
of payroll exempt from employer payroll
taxes. Let&#39;s not tax the gain on the
sale of a family-owned business to
reward our entrepreneurs for starting
their business here and creating jobs
and supporting the community. As you
know, many times these small businesses
on Main Street support the Cub Scouts,
the Girl Scouts, the Little League, the
Pop Warner, the PBA, the fire
professionals. Um, they&#39;re critical
components of the of the community. So,
let&#39;s reward them with the right kind of
tax policies.
&gt;&gt; And you&#39;ve served, of course, as a in
public service at many levels, uh, local
council, also state assembly. What
lessons from that local government role
you&#39;re going to now apply to the
statewide uh role because you are also
there very locally in this election you
go to the south of New Jersey north
everywhere. So what do you keep in mind
from your years when you were um a local
politician let&#39;s call it.
&gt;&gt; So not to be immodest but no candidate&#39;s
ever come before the people of New
Jersey before whose family has been here
for 100 years
&gt;&gt; who&#39;s an MBA CPA. I graduated from Satan
Hall University. My masters in finance
and passed the CPA exam because my
undergraduate degree was in accounting.
Someone who&#39;s been a two-time successful
business owner and u created jobs for
fellow New Jerseyians. Uh but somebody
to your point that served at every level
of government, municipal, county, and
legislative level. I always term limited
myself, never serving more than five or
six years at any spot. Uh at the
municipal and county level, I didn&#39;t
take the pay or the benefits. At the
state level, I didn&#39;t take the benefits.
And so, but what it does do is allows me
to be very very intimate with what&#39;s
going on in the community. Uh because
I&#39;ve been there raising kids, running a
business, my own business, serving. I
know what&#39;s going on. And I think this
is one of the things that differentiates
me from my opponent most. It&#39;s very very
clear from her run for governor. When
you talk with her or see her interviews,
she doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on and
therefore she doesn&#39;t have answers. I
know what&#39;s going on.
&gt;&gt; So let&#39;s go back to families.
Workingclass families in New Jersey. The
cost of living is rising. Affordability
is important to you. As I ask you about
small business, now I want to ask you
about those families. What step would
you take in the first 100 days? So, what
would be your first policy that would
affect the life of working-class
families that would be felt by them?
Let&#39;s call it um the soonest.
&gt;&gt; So, the lower and middle class of New
Jersey is getting crushed like never
before because of the affordability
crisis. What are the five components of
the affordability crisis? Taxes.
Everyone, we pay the highest taxes in
the nation. And don&#39;t forget, even if
you&#39;re a renter, you&#39;re paying taxes.
The the the landlord has to charge that
rent because of the taxes they&#39;re
paying. So taxes is number one. Two,
electricity rates. Look what&#39;s gone on
because of the failure of the current
administration. Three, housing. We need
more affordable housing. We just need to
be smart about where we put it. If
you&#39;re a family with young, young
children, child care, the child care
expenses off the charts. And then the
last thing, of course, is insurance. I
don&#39;t care what kind of insurance you&#39;re
buying today. House insurance, car
insurance, health insurance, it&#39;s gone
through the roof. So, I&#39;ve committed
myself to reducing the size and cost of
state government to afford a tax cut for
individuals and businesses. Uh, property
taxes. We need a new school funding
formula that will help lower property
taxes. Electricity rates, I&#39;m pulling us
out of Reggie. The regional greenhouse
gas initiative is a carbon tax policy
that has failed New Jerseyians. I could
save 300 to$500 million a year by
pulling out of that. Housing, we need
more affordable housing. And as
governor, I&#39;m going to advocate for
that. Child care. I want to provide
vouchers depending on where you are on
the income ladder. The lower you are on
the income ladder, we&#39;re going to give
you a voucher that you can use to go to
private daycare, child care, prek to
help offset that cost. And then for
insuranceances, we need more competition
in the state. The way to have more
competition is by having more companies
come here. You&#39;ll have more companies
come here if we make New Jersey a better
place to do business. More companies,
more competition. More competition,
lower rates.
&gt;&gt; And uh just because you mentioned
electricity, that was very important for
me to ask you. 45% more New Jersey pay,
residents of New Jersey pay than the
national average because of the changes.
Is that something you would tackle right
away?
&gt;&gt; Right away. So, one of my first
executive orders is we&#39;re pulling out a
Reggie. The regional greenhouse gas
initiative is a carbon tax policy that
makes electricity much more expensive
and it&#39;s failed New Jersey. I&#39;ll reopen
the electricity generation plants that
Phil Murphy closed down. I&#39;ll lift the
moratorium on natural gas fired
electricity generation plants. I&#39;ll
expand our nuclear footprint in South
Jersey. Uh I&#39;ll accelerate solar on the
rooftops of all the warehousing that&#39;s
gone up all across the state. That&#39;s
prime real estate for solar arrays and
it doesn&#39;t present a nimi issue. Not in
my backyard. No wind farms off our
jersey. Sure. Uh but these are the
things that we&#39;ll do to produce more
electricity. When Phil Murphy took
office eight years ago, New Jersey was
an electricity exporter. We produced
more electricity than we needed. Today
we have to import it because his
policies failed. He stopped all the
production of electricity and bet it all
on wind and wind is never going to be
able to satisfy our electricity
generation needs uh electricity demand
rather not to mention the fact that
people that live down the Jersey Shore
don&#39;t want those wind farms.
&gt;&gt; Now I want to talk about safety and also
you working with ICE if it comes to it.
Of course immigration it&#39;s a big part of
the state we are coming from immigrant
families but also people want safety and
they want order. So, what&#39;s going to be
your cooperation? Because I know that
you&#39;re planning to limit the sanctuary
cities, let&#39;s say, policies. Uh, but how
do you see yourself working with the
immigration law enforcement, keeping
immigrants safe, but also keeping the
residents safe? Sure. And those
residents are immigrants. So,
&gt;&gt; public safety is one of the big top four
issues in this race this year, along
with affordability, uh, public
education, and certainly overdevelopment
in our suburban communities. And so I&#39;ve
said from the very beginning on day one
by executive order, I get rid of
sanctuary cities. I get rid of sanctuary
state status. That encourages illegal
immigration and it handcuffs our local
police in certain ways that we
shouldn&#39;t. Uh the second thing I&#39;m going
to do is work with our law enforcement
community and the legislature to get rid
of cashless bail. Cashless bail has
created a professional criminal who&#39;s
learned how to game the system. Talk to
your local cops about arrest, release,
repeat. It&#39;s one of the reasons why
non-violent crime in this state has
spiked. Car thefts, breakins, flash mobs
at the Jersey Shore, flash mobs in our
malls. I appoint the attorney general. I
appoint the 21 county prosecutors to
whom local police chiefs report. I
appoint the superintendent of state
police. And with all those appointments,
we&#39;re going to work together to make New
Jersey safe once again.
&gt;&gt; And it comes to my mind, you&#39;re going to
be of course elected or not elected the
same day as New Yorkers are going to
elect their mayor. I&#39;m wondering does
this going to affect your work on this
level of immigration enforcement safety
because of course New York City is your
biggest neighbor. New York State is your
uh biggest neighbor? Are you even
looking at that? Are you thinking this
can affect anything on that level?
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m hoping Mandami doesn&#39;t win. But if
he does win, let me tell you what we&#39;re
going to do in New Jersey with me as
governor.
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re going to roll out the welcome map.
&gt;&gt; Anybody that wants to look to get out of
New York City, an individual or a
business, we&#39;re going to welcome them
right here. I&#39;ve got 400,000 New
Jerseyians that work in Manhattan each
and every day. And just because they&#39;ve
left our borders doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not
responsible for their safety. So, I&#39;ll
do all that I can to protect them. Um,
this is somebody who&#39;s been engaged in
anti-semitic rhetoric, anti-Italian
rhetoric, um, somebody who&#39;s been anti-
police, and I don&#39;t know how it is you
expect to run the city of New York
taking the positions he&#39;s filled. By the
way, my opponent has endorsed him, and
he&#39;s endorsed her.
parental rights and school
&gt;&gt; big deal
&gt;&gt; in New Jersey now. I feel like it&#39;s um
it&#39;s a little fight, let&#39;s call it
battle of values between the parents who
just want to have control over the kids
who are in school and those who stop
believing in public school system.
What&#39;s your take on that? How would you
encourage people to still believe in
public school system and that they
actually have a say about how their
education that their child&#39;s their
children&#39;s education is conducted? There
are things in the public school
curriculum that don&#39;t belong there.
&gt;&gt; I will remove them as governor in
partnership with my state board of
education. So, we&#39;re not going to teach
certain sensitive subject matter that I
believe belongs at home between parents
and their kids when the parents decide.
We&#39;re going to get back to teaching
critical life skills, reading, writing,
math, science, civics, provide
vocational training for kids because not
everybody wants or needs to go to
college. But we&#39;re also getting rid of
policy 5756. No longer will school
districts be keeping secrets from
parents. I believe that&#39;s immoral. It&#39;s
indecent. It&#39;s wrong. I also think it&#39;s
dangerous. Our children are best off
when parents and school districts work
in partnership, not in secret.
&gt;&gt; In the southern part of the state and
Malbor Township, but also it gained
national attention. Um people who are
running for school board, let&#39;s say, are
being threatened because of their
conservative values. And uh this shows
us how difficult it is to even stand up
for your values now because you will
face criticism. You will face threats.
What would you like to say about that?
And how would you ease those tens ease
those tensions because there is a huge
divide of values in this state. We see
it specifically in this race. We see it
very well.
&gt;&gt; First of all, when I&#39;m governor in
partnership with our law enforcement
community, no one will be threatened or
feel threatened. That&#39;s wrong. And so we
don&#39;t want to scare people out of
running for public office because
they&#39;re fearful of being threatened. And
so I think everybody needs to, you know,
ratchet down the ugly rhetoric. And I&#39;ve
always tried to conduct myself in a way.
I&#39;ve always made my position very clear,
but I&#39;ve always do it in very respectful
terms. So I think the governor has to
set the tone for how to engage with the
right kind of rhetoric. But let me be
clear, we&#39;re not going to be threatened
or have anybody feel threatened,
particularly those who want to run for
public office. And do you feel like
whatever you&#39;re saying is also appealing
to the other side of the political
spectrum?
So I mean you&#39;re counting on Democrats
also to give you the vote.
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely. I mean the Republicans
are the minority party in the state, but
the fact that I&#39;ve been endorsed uh by
13 different prominent Democrats around
the state says people want change. I
mean, take a look at your property tax
bill. Take a look at your monthly rent.
Take a look at your electric bill. Look
what&#39;s happened to public education.
Look what&#39;s happened to public safety
because we&#39;ve handcuffed our cops in the
rural suburbs. Look at the
overdevelopments taking place. Eight
years of Phil Murphy policies have been
a total failure and my opponent has
endorsed every one of those policies.
She will just be more the same only
worse. So I really believe the future of
our state hangs in the balance. We need
to make a change.
&gt;&gt; So when you think about yourself as a
governor in four years, how do you see
your legacy?
&gt;&gt; Well, I want New Jersey to be a place
that people can afford and with the
policies I put in place, I believe we
can make it more affordable. I want it
to be a safer place. And so by allowing
police officers to do their job, we can
make it safe once again. I want to fix
the public education system, right? We
want our children to be ready for
college or a career if they&#39;re not going
to college. And we want to stop all the
overdevelopment in our suburban
communities. Those are my four main
objectives.
&gt;&gt; So the last week, how is it going to be
for you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, really good. Like it&#39;s been every
other day since I declared for governor.
We get up and down the state every day
of the week. We touch no less than than
four counties a day. Uh yesterday was
eight stops. Today we&#39;ve got eight
stops. I love going out there. I love
engaging with New Jerseyians and talking
about how we&#39;re going to solve problems.
People like ideas
&gt;&gt; and one reason why I was a proud
Republican uh is because we&#39;ve always
been the party of ideas. So I&#39;m sharing
my ideas on how to fix New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much for your time. If
there&#39;s anything else you would like to
add, like a closing message from you.
&gt;&gt; Well, what I do say to and remind people
is the Democrats have controlled the
legislature now for 25 years. They&#39;ve
had the governor for the past eight
years. And so I say to people, if you&#39;re
not happy with the way things are in New
Jersey, if you want change, you got to
make a change. Now&#39;s the opportunity to
make that change. I promise we won&#39;t let
people down. And it&#39;s not just me I&#39;m
asking people to vote for. Vote for my
Republicans down ballot. Give us a
chance. Let us show you what we can do.
&gt;&gt; The most important, go out and vote.
&gt;&gt; Go out and vote.
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much, Jack Chidarelli.
The Republican candidate for the
governor of New Jersey was Rampa TV
guest. Thank you,
&gt;&gt; Rob. Thank you very much, Monica.
