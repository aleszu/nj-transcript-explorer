So day in and day out, what we're going to continue to do over the last 48 hours is what we've been doing every single day since June 11th. Right? She's trying to prove to you she's a Jersey girl. She's no Jersey girl. We kind of prove that. Okay? She wants you to think that she's a moderate. A moderate. She supported Joe Biden's open border policies. She supported every one of his inflationary policies. She voted no on the Lake and Riley Act. She supports sanctuary cities, us being a sanctuary state. She's endorsed Mandami. Madame's endorsed her. My goodness. This mother of two daughters voted yes twice to allow biological boys to play in girls sports. One of those 80, 20 issues here in New Jersey. This is somebody who voted no on the big beautiful bill which puts four to $5,000 a year back in the pockets of hard working, everyday New Jerseyans. She voted no on that bill. You know, the other thing really gets me. Here she comes talking about the Gateway project, about the snap. Those are important projects, right? 13 times during shutdowns during Joe Biden's administration, 13 times she voted yes to reopen the government now that Trump's the president. Guess what? She votes no. Okay. It's a shame, but she's a hypocrite. But listen, we've seen this movie before. They brought John Corzine here from Illinois. That didn't work out so well. They brought Bill Murphy in here from Massachusetts. This isn't working out so well. She's not from New Jersey. So I got a really simple idea. Haslett, you ready? How about we elect the Jersey guy? Let's elect the Jersey guy. Come on. Cheddarrons have been here for 100 years. Three generations of Cheddarlis have all achieved our American dream right here in New Jersey. Now fasten your seat belt. Here's how it goes down for the next 48 hours, just like it has every single day since June 11th. Are you ready? Are you ready? Say you're ready. Say I'm ready. I'm ready. She's ready. If any of you get a flat tire on the way home today, it's President Trump's fault. There is nothing she won't blame on President Trump. Now, after 25 years of the Democrats running our state government, eight years of Phil Murphy running the executive branch, look at your property tax bill. Look at your mother, the electricity bill. Look what they've done to public education. Look what they've done to public safety because they've handcap Hun handcuffed. Our cops look at the overdevelopments taking place in our suburbs. Does the President have anything to do with that? The Democrats who control Trenton have everything to do with that. And if she were elected, it's four more years of failed policies. Make no mistake, it's Murphy 2.0. But this is what she'll do. She'll blame the President for everything. Of course, while she's doing that, she'll remind you every single day that she's a woman. So Chairman Goldman has asked me to remind all of you. I'm a man. Just want to get that part straight. She's going to tell you every day that she's a mother of four children. Great. I'm a father of four children. She'll tell you every single day that she's an attorney. I'll you tell. I'll tell you. I'm a CPA business owner. She's going to tell you she knows how to run that helicopter. But if you watch this campaign, including the two debates, it is evident and it is clear she doesn't have a clue on how to run the state of New Jersey. She just does. She just doesn't. I will go as far as to say there's never been a more ill prepared or unqualified candidate for governor here in New Jersey. And that's why we got to win this race. But you know what? I've always been a proud Republican because we're the party of ideas, the party of solutions. So let's talk about what happens on day one of a Chedorelli administration. Okay, here's what happens on day one. Executive order number one. No town in this state will be a sanctuary city and we will not be a sanctuary state. We're not doing that. It encourages illegal immigration and handcuffs our local police. Executive order number two. We're bringing back to work our state workers. Have you tried getting somebody on the phone? Have you tried getting your issue resolved? You know what bugs the hell out of me? Because I'm proud of New Jersey. I, I want this state government to work for all of you. You can walk into a DMV office in Florida tomorrow. Sue. Walk out an hour later. Nick, with your real id. Call DMV here in New Jersey tomorrow for your real id. They're giving you an appointment in January. Okay? You pay for that state government when I'm your governor. It'll work for you every single day of the week. We're going to reduce the size and cost of this bloated inefficient state government to afford a tax cut for individuals and businesses. Or also on day one, you get an attorney general who supports both police and parents here in the state of New Jersey. How are we supporting police? We're getting rid of cashless bail. Cashless bail has created a professional criminal who's learned how to game the system. How will that attorney general support our parents? We're getting rid of Policy 5756. This notion of school districts keeping secrets from parents is immoral. It's indecent, it's wrong, it's dangerous. It ends. On day one of my administration, you'll get a whole new state board of education. We're getting our public school curriculum back on track. Reading, writing, math, science, civics, vocational training, and getting rid of all that other sensitive subject matter that belongs at home between parents and their kids. On day one, I will lower your electricity bill.}
