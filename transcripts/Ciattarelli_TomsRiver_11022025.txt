Ladies and gentlemen, the next governor
of the state of New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli.
So
I stole your finish.
[Applause]
Jack,
&gt;&gt; let&#39;s go.
[Music]
All right, Tom River, are you ready?
&gt;&gt; You know, let&#39;s see. I think it&#39;s about
in Let&#39;s see. In 2 days and 3 hours, we
are declaring victory. We&#39;re winning
this race.
[Music]
&gt;&gt; I love the energy you&#39;re bringing.
That&#39;s what wins races.
&gt;&gt; You know, there are a lot of differences
between me and my opponent, but right
here and right now, here&#39;s one of the
biggest differences. I know where the
hell Tom&#39;s River is.
&gt;&gt; She She wants you to think she&#39;s a
Jersey girl, but she&#39;s having trouble
getting her way around New Jersey. Did
you see the other day she was streaming
live on Facebook? She was in Middle Sex
County. She&#39;s trying to show you her
travels around the state as limited as
they&#39;ve been. And she&#39;s we&#39;re in Middle
Sex County. We&#39;re going up to Burlington
County.
All right. Those of you that didn&#39;t get
the joke, you just failed the test in
New Jersey geography. When you&#39;re in
Middle Sex, you do not go up to
Burlington County. You just don&#39;t.
&gt;&gt; We are going to win this race. And
there&#39;s positive signs everywhere. We&#39;re
going to win this race. Have you seen
the latest polls?
&gt;&gt; Huh?
&gt;&gt; We are right where we need to be. Right
where we need to be.
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re out fundraising my opponent. We&#39;re
out energizing my opponent. And uh in
the last 48 hours, we picked up our 14th
prominent Democrat who&#39;s endorsed yours
truly for governor.
&gt;&gt; So when the Democrats are endorsing the
Republican nominee, what does it tell
you, Kelsey? You know what it tells you?
&gt;&gt; They want to be on the winning team are
going to win this thing.
&gt;&gt; Mr. Sheriff&#39;s in the house.
&gt;&gt; Mike Mastard is here
right here, right now in Ocean County.
There&#39;s only one guy more popular than
Jack Cherelli. That&#39;s Mike Mastinardi.
&gt;&gt; Well, listen. What we are going to do
over the next 48 hours is what we&#39;ve
been doing every single day since June
11th. And first and foremost, that is
telling New Jersey who Mikey Cheryl
really is. We&#39;ve already proved she&#39;s no
Jersey girl. The other proof of that is
she doesn&#39;t know when it&#39;s Taylor Ham.
She don&#39;t know when it&#39;s pork roll.
Now I know where I am
&gt;&gt; and it&#39;s pork roll.
&gt;&gt; All right. Last night I was in Bergen
County and it was Taylor Ham. I know you
understand cuz it&#39;s all about winning
this race. Okay. But we&#39;re going to tell
New Jersey who my opponent really is.
She wants you to think she&#39;s a moderate.
She&#39;s no moderate. Here&#39;s the record.
She supported Joe Biden&#39;s open border
policies. Supported Joe Biden&#39;s
inflationary policies. She voted no on
the Lake and Riley Act. You know who&#39;s
here today? Where&#39;s Congressman? Lawler
is here today. Our 13th House member,
&gt;&gt; of course. Chris Smith is in the house.
&gt;&gt; Chris Smith is in the house. And I&#39;m
proud to have his support.
You know, many people think we have only
12 house members. We got 12 and a half.
Mike Lawler is the other half. He
represents New York on the other side of
the Bergen County borger, but we&#39;re
happy to have him here. Let&#39;s warm
welcome to Mike Lawler.
These two guys voted yes on the Lake and
Rally Act. My opponent voted no. She
supports sanctuary cities, us being a
sanctuary state. She voted no on the big
beautiful bill which puts four to 5,000
a year back in the pockets of
hardworking middle class New Jerseyians.
She supports Mandami and Mandami
supports her.
&gt;&gt; Hey, we&#39;ve seen this horror movie
before. They brought John Cororsine here
from Illinois. That didn&#39;t work out so
well. They brought Phil Murphy in here
from Massachusetts. This has not worked
out so well. My opponent&#39;s not from New
Jersey. She hasn&#39;t been here all that
long. And what little time she&#39;s been
here, she&#39;s been six years in Congress
and somehow someway tripled her net
worth. And when she was asked how she
made $7 million, she said, &quot;I I think we
made money.&quot; Who wouldn&#39;t know if they
made $7 million? Come on. Right. Come
on. So, I got a really simple idea.
&gt;&gt; How about we elect the Jersey guy?
&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s elect the Jersey guy.
&gt;&gt; Cheddarellis have been here for a 100
years.
&gt;&gt; Three generations of Chedarellis have
all achieved their American dream right
here in New Jersey. And the point I&#39;m
trying to make is unlike my opponent, I
know what the hell&#39;s going on in this
state and I know what needs fixing. Now
listen, fasten your seat belts cuz
here&#39;s what she&#39;s going to do over the
next 48 hours, as she&#39;s been doing every
day since June 11th. If tonight on the
way home, you get a flat tire. It&#39;s
President Trump&#39;s fault.
The entire campaign is a stack of lies
about me. Her disdain for the president,
she could fly a helicopter. Is that
going to fix New Jersey?
&gt;&gt; Let me ask you something. Does the
president have anything to do with our
property taxes?
&gt;&gt; Does he have anything to do with our
electric bills? Does he have anything to
do with the overdevelopments taking
place in our suburban communities?
&gt;&gt; Okay, they&#39;ve also screwed up public
education and public safety. This is all
at the hands of the pardons controlled
Trenton for 25 years. The president&#39;s
got nothing to do with it. But here&#39;s
the other thing she&#39;ll do over the next
48 hours. In addition to blaming the
president for everything, she&#39;s going to
remind you every day she&#39;s a woman.
Okay? So, Congressman Chris Smith has
asked me to remind all of you I&#39;m a man.
Congressman, right? We&#39;re going to make
that perfectly clear. She&#39;s going to
remind you every day she&#39;s a mother of
four. I&#39;ll remind you I&#39;m a father of
four. She&#39;s going to tell you she&#39;s an
attorney. I&#39;ll tell you I&#39;m a CPA
business owner in this state. She&#39;s
going to tell you she knows how to run a
helicopter. But it&#39;s evident from this
campaign and her two debate performances
she doesn&#39;t know a damn thing about
running in the state of New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; She doesn&#39;t
see the interview.
So, Congresswoman, you win the
governorhip. It&#39;s day one. What do you
do?
&gt;&gt; So, you did see that commercial.
&gt;&gt; That was good. That was good. I&#39;ve been
asked that question all over the state.
And I tell you what, Tom&#39;s River did the
best on that one. You guys can
I&#39;m a proud Republican for a number of
reasons. One of which is we&#39;ve always
been the party of ideas. We&#39;ve always
been the party of solutions. So, let&#39;s
talk about what happens on day one of a
Chedel administration. Executive order
number one. No town in this state will
be a sanctuary city and we will not be a
sanctuary state.
We are not going to encourage illegal
immigration. Bob Shay, we&#39;re not going
to make the job of local law enforcement
harder. Executive order number two,
we&#39;re bringing back to work all of our
state workers. Phil Murphy&#39;s got them
working from home post pandemic. Have
you tried getting somebody on the phone?
Have you tried getting your issue
resolved? You know what I find
embarrassing? is a proud Republican
wants to be your governor. You can walk
into a DMV office in Florida tomorrow,
walk out an hour later with your real
ID.
&gt;&gt; I heard that.
&gt;&gt; Call DMV DMV in New Jersey tomorrow for
your real ID. They&#39;re giving you an
appointment in January.
&gt;&gt; I find that embarrassing. When I&#39;m your
governor, they work for us. They&#39;re
coming to work and your state government
will work for you.
On day one, I&#39;m going to reduce the size
and cost of this bloated, inefficient
state government to afford a tax cut for
individuals and businesses here in New
Jersey. On day one, you get an attorney
general who supports both police and
parents here in the state of New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; How are we going to support our police?
We&#39;re getting rid of cashless bail.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s created a professional criminal
who&#39;s learned how to game the system.
How will my attorney general support
parents? Policy 5756 is gone on day one.
No longer will school districts be
keeping secrets from parents. It&#39;s
immoral. It&#39;s indecent. It&#39;s wrong. And
it&#39;s dangerous. We&#39;re not keeping
secrets from parents.
I like it. I like it.
&gt;&gt; On day one, you get a whole new state
board of education. We&#39;re going to fix
the public school curriculum. We&#39;re
getting back to the basics. reading,
writing, math, science, civics,
vocational training with an age
appropriate curriculum. Also, on day
one, I will lower your electricity bill
on day one by pulling out of Phil
Murphy&#39;s capp trade carbon tax policy.
Now, the only time in this entire 4 and
a half month campaign for governor that
my opponent has been specific is on
energy. You&#39;ve seen the commercial. On
day one, I will declare a state of
emergency and freeze your energy rates.
Why would we freeze them at an all-time
high?
77 incumbent Democratic legislators, 52
of which are on the ballot this year.
Not one has endorsed her plan. Not one
has embraced her plan. And the governor
of her own party went on TV when asked
about her plan said, &quot;I don&#39;t think you
can do that. You can&#39;t do it. It&#39;s a
lie. I&#39;ll lower it by pulling out of
Reggie that carbon tax policy. What I&#39;m
also going to do on day one when it
comes to energy, I&#39;m getting rid of the
EV mandate. I&#39;m never telling you what
car you got to buy. I&#39;m not telling you
how to heat your homes. I&#39;m not telling
you what appliances you have to buy. Let
me be clear. There&#39;ll be no wind farms
off our Jersey shore.
&gt;&gt; Chris, come here. Watch this, Chris. And
here&#39;s the best part of my energy plan.
At the supermarket, you can have back
your plastic bags.
[Applause]
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; We&#39;ll get you your straws, too.
&gt;&gt; Now, you know who&#39;s with us here
tonight? We got Joe and KC from the
Republican National Committee here
tonight.
&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s give a warm New Jersey welcome.
Casey&#39;s been here so often we start
charging her property taxes.
We might even get her vote by mail
ballot. Who knows? Casey and Joe, did
you notice something here tonight? I
could say I&#39;m going to lower taxes and I
get a nice little round of applause. I
say I&#39;m bringing back the plastic bags.
It&#39;ll bring down the house every single
time.
Hey, something else this community is
all too familiar with. Okay. On day one,
my council goes before the state supreme
court with two arguments that are long
overdue. There&#39;s a couple things the
Supreme Court doesn&#39;t know, but I&#39;m
telling you here now, we are going to
stop all this high density
overdevelopment in our suburban
communities.
&gt;&gt; And the other thing we&#39;re going to do,
we&#39;re going to have a new school funding
formula so Tom&#39;s River doesn&#39;t get
screwed screwed on school funding. And
then we&#39;ll lower your property taxes.
And by the way, I&#39;m all about being
transparent. If that Supreme Court
doesn&#39;t agree with me on those two
issues, guess what your next governor
gets to do? Two new Supreme Court, state
justice,
one of which is the Chief Justice. And
I&#39;m not appointing anybody that doesn&#39;t
agree with us on these two issues. Guys,
I could not be more excited. I hope you
are, too. We&#39;ve got to finish strong.
We&#39;re going to make this happen. Why am
I running for governor? I want to get
back to a day that I remember very
fondly. The New Jersey I remember, the
New Jersey I grew up in. My parents
never had to worry about me walking to
the bus stop. They never had to worry
about what I was learning in school that
day. That was a time and error when
well, if my parents got a phone call
from any of the sisters at St. An&#39;s, the
local cop or my teacher, I was in
serious when I got home.
I just thank God there was no Costco
back then. You&#39;ve seen the size of these
wooden spoons today,
Greg. think I would end up in the ER if
my mother had one of those.
That was a time when my hardworking
middle-class parents, who both worked
two jobs, could be confident in keeping
the roof over the head, the meal on
table, and the clothes in the back of
their four children. They could be
confident that their kids were going to
do better than they. We got to get back
to that day. And that&#39;s what this
campaign is all about. That&#39;s what I&#39;m
all about. We can do this.
We can do this.
So, a couple things I want you to know
about me. It&#39;s a little selfish, but
it&#39;s certainly something I want you to
know. I&#39;ve been very fortunate because
of my hard work. We have achieved the
American dream here in New Jersey, the
Cheddarellis. I want people to feel
confident they can achieve their
American dream right here in New Jersey.
Right. But the point I&#39;m trying to make
with the utmost humility is this is no
vanity tour and I don&#39;t need the job.
But make no mistake, I want this job on
your behalf, on our behalf. When
something I love is broken, I want to
fix it. New Jerseyy&#39;s broken. And I
would never ask for your energy, your
time, your vote, and I looking around
the room here, in some cases, the check
that some of you wrote. I wouldn&#39;t ask
for any of that unless I believe my
brand of leadership could fix New
Jersey. But that&#39;s my only ambition. I
don&#39;t want to be congressman. No
disrespect.
I don&#39;t want to be US senator. I don&#39;t
want to be president and I don&#39;t want to
write a book. I just want to write the
ship. Let&#39;s get this done.
&gt;&gt; Let&#39;s get this done.
The other thing I want you to know is
unlike the current governor and my
opponent, I&#39;m not owned by any special
interests. Okay? There are powerful
special interests out there lying about
me every single day. These are the
people that will control my opponent if
she were to win. Let me be very clear
about something. If there&#39;s any teachers
here, fire personnel, fire
professionals, or police, you&#39;re the
middle class and you&#39;re getting crushed
like never before because of the
failures of current administration. I&#39;m
not taking your pension away. Your
pension is critically important to your
your family&#39;s financial security.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m not raising your sales tax to 10%.
We&#39;re lowering taxes, but I&#39;m not owed
by any special interests. Once your
governor is owned, they&#39;re compromised.
And once they&#39;re compromised, it&#39;s over.
You don&#39;t need to worry about that with
me. My only ambition is to fix the state
we all love. And when this is all over
after 48 years, I&#39;m going to the beach
in Surf City.
&gt;&gt; All right, that&#39;s where I&#39;m going. This
is home. Always has been, always will
be. So now it&#39;s time for the call to
action, right? Championship teams do
what? They finish strong and they win
championships. You&#39;re all on the team.
So here&#39;s the first thing I need you to
do. If any of you come across anybody
who&#39;s not voting for Jack Chedarelli in
the next 48 hours with passion, with
conviction, and with determination, I
want you to practice if you need to. You
tell them that election day is
Wednesday, November 5th.
What&#39;s so damn funny? I&#39;m not joking.
You&#39;re never going to hear me say this
is the most important election of our
lifetime. I think every election is
equally important for different reasons.
But I will say this, the future of our
state hangs in the balance.
&gt;&gt; Within two months time, I will be 64. I
don&#39;t ever remember it ever being this
bad. Take a look at your property tax
bill. If you&#39;re a tenant, take a look at
your monthly rent. Take a look at your
monthly electric bill. Take a look at
what they&#39;ve done to public education.
Take a look what they&#39;ve done to public
safety because they&#39;ve handcuffed our
cops. Take a look at what they&#39;re doing
all across this state with the suburban
overdevelopments taking place. This is
at the feet of the party that&#39;s
controlled Trenton for 25 years and the
executive branch for the last eight
years. We cannot afford another day of
those for failed policies. And make no
mistake, if my opponent&#39;s elected, okay,
it&#39;s more the same, only worse. She is
Murphy 2.0. We cannot let this happen.
So, let&#39;s be a championship team. You&#39;re
going to go out and anybody you come
across in your neighborhood, your place
of work, your house of worship, your
social networks, I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s
aisle eight at the supermarket. If it&#39;s
a New Jerseyian, I&#39;m sure they&#39;re pissed
about something. Ask them, are you
voting? You need to vote. Are you upset
about something? Well, then you need to
facilitate change by voting for Jack
Chedarelli. So, we&#39;re going to finish
strong. We&#39;re get this done, aren&#39;t we?
&gt;&gt; All right. Now,
&gt;&gt; let&#39;s go is right. Now, before I said we
are going to win this year, and when I
say we, I&#39;m not talking about me. I&#39;m
talking about everybody down ballot.
Now, back in 2021, with me at the top of
the ticket, we flipped 134 seats at the
municipal county level, over 200 board
of education seats, and eight seats in
the state legislature. The most
successful night in 34 years for
Republican party. I think I was the only
guy that lost that night. I&#39;m still in
therapy.
A win will get me out. But that success
was with wind in our face. We got wind
on our back this time around. I&#39;m
telling you here and now. We do this
right, we can flip 13 seats in
legislature. When we do that, we get
something we haven&#39;t had in 25 years.
How about a Republican majority?
&gt;&gt; Come on.
Come on.
Greg McGuck&#39;s here tonight.
David, how are you, buddy?
We can do this.
So with that, let&#39;s finish strong. Let&#39;s
be a championship team. What&#39;s the theme
for this campaign?
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s time again.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s time. No, no, no. It is. We want to
make New Jersey great again. But that&#39;s
our theme right there.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s been the case for 18 months. We
can&#39;t change it with two days to go.
&gt;&gt; I was at a rally last night and guys
started yelling me, &quot;It&#39;s past time.
It&#39;s past time.&quot; It&#39;s okay. All right.
All right. I get it. It&#39;s time. It&#39;s
time to vote. It&#39;s time to win. It&#39;s
time to fix New Jersey. Let&#39;s get this
done. Let&#39;s get this done. Come on.
Let&#39;s get this done. All right. Come on.
Finish strong with me. Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s
get it done. Thank you, guys. Thank you,
Tom.
[Applause]
