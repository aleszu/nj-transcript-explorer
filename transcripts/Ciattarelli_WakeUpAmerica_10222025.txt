Republican candidate Jack Chidarelli.
Great to have you here. Great to see you
again.
&gt;&gt; How are you feeling looking at the
polls? Uh it was you trailing now it&#39;s
real close, almost within the margin of
error. How are you feeling right now as
we head towards election day?
&gt;&gt; John, we&#39;ve got it as a dead heat.
Remember, New Jersey is a state where
Republicans typically underpole because
we are the minority party. But people
are angry up and down the state. We&#39;ve
got an affordability crisis, a public
safety crisis, public education crisis,
and a whole lot of unnecessary
overdevelopment. in our sub suburban
communities, people are ticked and uh
they know this is a change election.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I know that you&#39;ve received
what would normally be a a coveted
endorsement from President Trump, but in
a blue state like New Jersey where your
opponent is really trying to use Trump
against you. What do you say to the
voters who might think that endorsement
may not be a good thing?
&gt;&gt; Hey, certainly the Trump endorsement is
great, but just as great are the
endorsements we&#39;ve gotten from
Democratic mayors all up and down the
state. There isn&#39;t a single Republican
that&#39;s endorsed my opponent. Even
Democrats want change because of the
failed policies of the past eight years.
And people across the state know that my
opponent is probably the most
ill-prepared and unqualified candidate
we&#39;ve ever seen and would just be Murphy
2.0. Again, this is a change election.
I&#39;m a change agent. And so, we&#39;ll count
the votes in 13 days, but I&#39;m confident
we&#39;re going to deliver a win.
&gt;&gt; Can I throw a hypothetical at you?
You&#39;ve got, let&#39;s say you win in New
Jersey. We&#39;re watching this New York
City mayoral race right now with Zoron
Mandani being the front runner there. If
he in fact wins New York, what does that
mean for New Jersey? Do you see some
people leaving New York to go to New
Jersey? And does that mean bigger things
for your economy?
&gt;&gt; Uh, it means we&#39;re going to roll out the
welcome mat, not just for individuals,
but also for businesses as well. But
let&#39;s not forget, my opponent has
endorsed Mundami. He&#39;s endorsed her. I&#39;m
hoping he doesn&#39;t succeed. And um, you
know, we&#39;re going to make sure New
Jerseyians are safe even when they leave
New Jersey. uh if he is the mayor.
&gt;&gt; There are a lot a lot of people that are
considering that if Mandani does win,
I&#39;ve heard from people here in New York
City that say, &quot;I might go over to New
Jersey if Manny wins in New York City.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Yeah, seems like
&gt;&gt; there&#39;s been a whole lot hatefueled
rhetoric out of Mandami towards Jews,
towards Italians and his socialist
views.
&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the good news. New Jersey is not
New York City. So, we&#39;re right in
position. I really like where we are
today. We&#39;ll finish strong of
campaigning over the next 13 days to
deliver a win. What are some of the
issues that you&#39;re hearing the most
about from people in New Jersey that
they really care about this election?
&gt;&gt; Affordability. Our property taxes are
through the roof. Of course, housing is
exorbitantly expensive. Look at your
monthly electric bill. If you&#39;re a
family with small kids, child care is
through the roof. It&#39;s crushing the
middle class here in New Jersey. There&#39;s
different things we need to do with
regard to policy to make it all better.
And I&#39;ve been very specific on that
front. There&#39;s been no specifics out of
my opponent. The whole campaign of hers
has been based on a stack of lies, her
disdain for the president, and she can
fly a helicopter. None of which is going
to fix New Jersey. We&#39;re also going to
back up our police. We&#39;ve got a public
safety crisis in the state. We need to
take the handcuffs off. Let the men and
women in blue do their job and keep our
community safe.
&gt;&gt; This is the third time here attempt to
run for governor. Um 2021, you lost by
just a few percentage points. What&#39;s
different this time around? Do you think
that people have now changed their
mindset? Maybe where things are at
politically? Couple things are
different, John. Number one, I&#39;m not
competing with a pandemic this time. Not
easy to run for governor when there&#39;s a
shelter in place order. Not going
against an incumbent. Phil Murphy did
leverage the power of incumbency.
There&#39;s a lot less indifference now.
People know we can win. So, I&#39;m
expecting a much better turnout. And the
other thing is all the things I was
talking about in 21, they were
percolating then. They&#39;ve come to a
complete boil now. People are pissed.
The affordability crisis, public safety,
public education, and overdevelopment
are the key issues here. I&#39;ve given
forth very specific policy proposals on
how to fix each one of those. People
like ideas.
&gt;&gt; Jackelli, thank you for taking the time.
Best of luck to you. 13 days to go.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, guys.
