THANK YOU.
&gt;&gt; Brian: 25 BEFORE TOP OF THE
HOUR.

GRONK.
AND NEW JERSEY RACE,
CONGRESSWOMAN SHERRILL FACING
JACK CIATTARELLI.
&gt;&gt; Ainsley: LATEST POLLING SHOWS
SHE IS AHEAD BY NINE POINTS.
REPUBLICAN CIATTARELLI SAYS NOT
TO COUNT HIM OUT.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: STEVE DOOCY IS LIVE
AT THE CHIT-CHAT DINER IN

HACKENSACK.
HI, STEVE.
[CHEERING]
&gt;&gt; Steve: ALL RIGHT.
HE JUST JOINED US.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, JACK
CIATTARELLI.
[CHEERING]
&gt;&gt; Steve: YOU HAD US GOING FOR A
WHILE, JACK.
BIG TRAFFIC TIE-UP ON ROUTE 80.
&gt;&gt; EXECUTIVE ORDER NUMBER ONE,
NO MORE TRAFFIC JAMS IN NEW
JERSEY.
&gt;&gt; Steve: OKAY, I THINK HE&#39;S GOT
OUR VOTE IN THAT CASE.
JACK, WE DID INVITE YOUR
COMPETITION, AND WE HAVE NOT
HEARD BACK FROM HER YET.
&gt;&gt; NOR ARE YOU GOING TO.
&gt;&gt; Steve: HOW CLOSE ARE YOU?
LAST TIME YOU RAN, POLLING
SUGGESTED DOUBLE DIGITS APART,
ONLY THREE POINTS BEHIND.
&gt;&gt; WE&#39;RE RIGHT WHERE WE NEED TO
BE, 61 DAYS TO GO, WE&#39;LL FINISH
STRONG AND DELIVER A WIN FOR NEW
JERSEY.
&gt;&gt; Steve: OKAY.
[CHEERING]
&gt;&gt; Steve: WHEN IT COMES TO NEW
JERSEY, WE ARE FAMOUS HERE AND
I&#39;VE LIVED HERE 31 YEARS, FAMOUS
FOR HAVING TAXES THAT REALLY
SUCK.
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
&gt;&gt; WE ARE ALSO FAMOUS FOR THE
BEST DINERS IN THE COUNTRY.
&gt;&gt; Steve: DODGING THE QUESTION,
WHAT ABOUT TAXES?
&gt;&gt; I WILL REDUCE FOR INDIVIDUALS
AND BUSINESSES AND LOWER
PROPERTY TAXES AND GET IT DONE.
&gt;&gt; Steve: PEOPLE TALK ABOUT I&#39;M
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT THIS
WAY OR THAT WAY, YOU HAVE TO GET
BUY-IN FROM PEOPLE IN THE STATE
CAPITOL.
&gt;&gt; WE WILL WIN A REPUBLICAN
MAJORITY, WE FLIPPED EIGHT SEATS
WHEN I WAS ATOP THE TICKET, WE
CAN FLIP 13.
WE WILL GET A REPUBLICAN
MAJORITY IN STATE LEGISLATURE.
&gt;&gt; Steve: JACK, IT IS A VERY
BLUE STATE, WASN&#39;T THAT LONG AGO
CHRIS CHRISTIE WAS THE GOVERNOR.
&gt;&gt; GUBERNATORIAL, THIS IS NOT A
DEEP BLUE STATE, WE ARE GOING
SEVEN FOR 12 WITH A WIN THIS
YEAR.
&gt;&gt; Steve: THERE YOU GO.
IT MEANS LIKE PING-PONG,
DEMOCRATS TAKE IT FOR A WHILE,
REPUBLICANS.
IS IT YOUR TURN?
&gt;&gt; PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT AND DO NOT
WANT PHIL MURPHY&#39;S FAILED
POLICIES, MY OPPONENT IS FILL
MURPHY 2.0.
LIKE CORZINE, AND MURPHY, THEY
ARE NOT FROM JERSEY.
HOW ABOUT ELECT A JERSEY GUY.
&gt;&gt; Steve: RIGHT.
ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT NEW
JERSEY IS THE LIGHT BILL HAS
GONE THROUGH THE ROOF.
WE HAD A GUY, BARRY, HIS LIGHT
BILL WENT UP TO $600 FOR A
MODEST HOUSE.
&gt;&gt; PHIL MURPHY SHUT DOWN
ELECTRICITY GENERATION PLANTS,
DIDN&#39;T ACCELERATE SOLAR, BET IT
ON WIND AND HERE WE ARE DEAD
ELECTRICITY IMPORTER INSTEAD OF
EXPORTER.
THEIR BILL IS GOING THROUGH THE
ROOF, IT IS HOMEOWNERS, TENANTS
AND  BUSINESS OWNERS.
I CAN FIX IT DAY 1.
&gt;&gt; Steve: INDEPENDENTS ARE SPLIT
DOWN THE MIDDLE.
I KNOW DONALD TRUMP HAS ENDORSED
YOU.
&gt;&gt; HE HAS.
MAJORITY PARTY IS WHAT YOU SAID
2.6 MILLION INDEPENDENT VOTERS.
AFTER FAILED POLICIES, THEY ARE
LEANING CIATTARELLI.
&gt;&gt; Steve: JACK CIATTARELLI, GOOD
LUCK TO YOU.
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US LIVE.
HE SAID WE HAVE THE BEST DINERS
IN THE WORLD, I THINK YOU WOULD
AGREE WITH THAT.
LIVE FRO
