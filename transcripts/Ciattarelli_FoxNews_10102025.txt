N
THE COACH.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: SOGGY AND WET.
&gt;&gt; Ainsley: WORST WORDS, EVER.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: CANDIDATES FOR NEW
JERSEY GOVERNOR SQUARE OFF IN
SECOND AND FINAL DEBATE
WEDNESDAY NIGHT BEFORE THE
ELECTION.
&gt;&gt; I THINK JACK WORKS TO SAY
ANYTHING HE CAN TO ANYONE, BUT,
AT THE END OF THE DAY, HE IS
ALWAYS GOING TO DO WHAT TRUMP
TELLS HIM TO DO.
&gt;&gt; SHE IS GIVING SOME KIND OF
WEIRD ENDORSEMENT OF MAMDANI.
MAMDANI HAS ENDORSED HER.
&gt;&gt; I WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR
NEW JERSIANS, AND MY OPPONENT
JUST WON&#39;T.
&gt;&gt; SHE ISSUED A STATEMENT
CONDEMNING CHARLIE KIRK, CALLING
HIM MISOGYNIST AND A RACIST.
FIRST OF ALL, SHAME ON YOU.
SECOND OF ALL.
&gt;&gt; SHAME ON YOU, SIR.
&gt;&gt; SHAME ON YOU.
&gt;&gt; Ainsley: IN OUR LATEST FOX
NEWS POLL, CONGRESSWOMAN MIKIE
SHERRILL HOLDS 8 POINT LEAD OVER
JACK CIATTARELLI BUT TODAY OR
TONIGHT I SHOULD SAY,
CIATTARELLI WILL HOLD A RALLY AS
HE LOOKS TO CLOSE THAT GAP.
&gt;&gt; HE JOINS US NOW.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING &quot;FOX
&amp; FRIENDS.&quot;
&gt;&gt; GUYS, GREAT TO BE WITH YOU.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: I&#39;M CURIOUS, JACK,
DO YOU SEE A SHIFT ON THE
GROUND?
BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE POLLING
CAN JUST BE WRONG.
&gt;&gt; THERE IS A SHIFT ON THE
GROUND, GUYS, I HAVE TO TELL YOU
YOUR POLL IS AN OUTLIER.
THERE IS A NUMBER OF POLLS THAT
HAVE THIS AS A DEAD HEAT.
REPUBLICANS TRADITIONALLY
UNDERPOLL NEW JERSEY, THERE IS
ENERGY EVERYWHERE I GO.
AND LAST NIGHT WE PICKED UP
ANOTHER VERY SIGNIFICANT
ENDORSEMENT FROM ANOTHER
DEMOCRATIC MAYOR.
IT&#39;S NOT THE FIRST, IT&#39;S NOT
GOING TO BE THE LAST.
THERE ISN&#39;T A SINGLE REPUBLICAN
THAT HAS ENDORSED MY OPPONENT
WHOSE ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS BASED
ON A STATISTIC LIES FOR DISDAIN
FOR DONALD TRUMP, AND THAT SHE
CAN FLY A HELICOPTER.
NONE OF THAT IS GOING TO FIX NEW
JERSEY.
&gt;&gt; Ainsley: I KNOW YOU ARE GOING
TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS IN THE
DINER.
WE HEARD QUESTIONS THIS MORNING
FROM FOLKS IN YOUR STATE, ISSUES
IN NEW JERSEY ARE THE HIGHER
ENERGY COSTS, IMMIGRATION,
PROPERTY TAXES, OVERALL COST OF
LIVING.
THOSE ARE ACTUALLY PROBLEMS THAT
A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AROUND THE
COUNTRY ARE FACING, TOO.
SO, WHEN YOU LOOK AT YOUR STATE
AND YOU SEE HOW CLOSE OR NECK
AND NECK YOU ARE IN A BLUE
STATE, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU
ABOUT THE SHIFT IN OUR CULTURE
AROUND THE COUNTRY?
&gt;&gt; ALL I COULD TELL YOU ABOUT
WHAT IS GOING ON IN NEW JERSEY
AND PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT.
THEY ARE ANGRY.
8 YEARS OF PHIL MURPHY&#39;S FAILED
POLICIES AND MY OPPONENT IS MORE
THE SAME, ONLY WORSE IF SHE WERE
TO BE ELECTED.
PEOPLE HAVE HAD IT WOULD DO HAVE
THE HIGHEST PROPERTY TAX IN THE
NATION.
BECAUSE OF A FAILED MASTER
ENERGY PLAN MY OPPONENT HAS
DOUBLED DOWN ON.
NOT GOING TO BE WIND FARMS OFF
OUR NEW JERSEY SHORE NOT
RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE.
GO BACK TO SOMETHING MORE
RATIONAL GET THE ELECTRIC BILL
DONE.
I WILL DAY ONE.
CARBON TAX POLICY HAS FAILED NEW
JERSEY.
PUBLIC EDUCATION IS FAILING
HERE.
PUBLIC SAFETY.
THERE HAS BEEN ENORMOUS SPIKE IN
NONVIOLENT CRIME BECAUSE WE ARE
SOFT ON CRIMINALS.
AND WE HAVE GOT A SEVERE
OVERDEVELOPMENT CRISIS FOUR
SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF
DEMOCRATS&#39; IDEA OF SOCIAL
ENGINEERING.
&gt;&gt; Lawrence: THERE IS A LOT OF
PEOPLE FROM NEW YORK THAT ARE
GOING TO FLEE BECAUSE YOU HAVE
GOT MAMDANI WHO IS ALMOST
CERTAIN TO WIN.
BUT THERE IS A STILL A CHANCE
THAT YOU CAN WIN.
ARE YOU SEEING PEOPLE GET MORE
INVOLVED BECAUSE OF THAT FACT
ALONE?
&gt;&gt; GUYS, I WILL TELL YOU WE&#39;RE
GOING TO WIN.
WE ARE RIGHT WHERE WE NEED TO BE
WITH 24 DAYS TO GO.
WE WILL DELIVER A WIN HERE FOR
NEW JERSEY.
BUT, YES IF MAMDANI WERE TO WIN
WE WILL ROLL OUT THE MAP.
VERY OFFENSIVE TO JEWS AND
ITALIANS, I KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT
CAN&#39;T ALL BE HAPPY ME OPPONENT
ENDORSED MAMDANI, HE HAS
ENDORSED HER.
THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE PUBLIC
SPEAR FOR SOMEBODY LIKE MAMDANI
WHO FILLS THE AIR WITH
HATE-FUELED RHETORIC.
WE WILL BE ROLLING OUT THE HE
CAN WELCOME MAT NOT ONLY FOR
CITIZENS BUT BUSINESSES TOO THAT
HE GOING TO RAISE TAXES ON.
&gt;&gt; Ainsley: STEVE DOOCY IS IN
YOUR STATE WILDWOOD DINER IN NEW
JERSEY.
HE HAS QUESTIONS, I THINK, FOR
YOU, TOO.
&gt;&gt; Steve: I DO INDEED, AINSLEY.
WE ARE HERE AT THE VEGAS DINER
WHERE I THINK -- ANYBODY GOING
TO THE RALLY TONIGHT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
I KNOW SCOTT PRESLER RIGHT BACK
THERE IS GOING TO GO TO THE
RALLY.
JACK, WE HAVE GOT SOME QUESTIONS
FOR YOU.
FIRST UP IS WANDA.
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOUR
QUESTION IS FOR JACK
CIATTARELLI.
&gt;&gt; HI, JACK.
MY ENERGY BILLS HAVE PRACTICALLY
DOUBLED THIS SUMMER CRAZY, BILLS
5 OR $600.
I DON&#39;T EVEN OWN A SWIMMING
POOL.
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN TO REDUCE
THOSE COSTS AND BRING ENERGY
COSTS BACK TO NEW JERSEY?
&gt;&gt; GOOD ONE, WANDA.
STEVE, I CAN&#39;T TELL YOU HOW
JEALOUS I AM I&#39;M NOT THERE WITH
YOU.
WE ARE PART OF THE DINER TOUR
EVERY DAY.
LISTEN, OPPONENT BLAMED
EVERYTHING WITH THE PRESIDENT.
HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH PHIL
MURPHY&#39;S POLICIES.
I WILL PULL US OUT OF REGGIE.
CARBON TAX POLICY THAT COST NEW
JERSIANS ANYWHERE FROM 300 TO
500 MILLION EVERY YEAR.
THE GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA IS
NOT RELIGIONY.
WE SHOULD NOT BE EITHER.
I COULD SAY 300 TO $500 MILLION
A YEAR.
HOMEOWNERS, TENANTS AND
BUSINESSES ALL ACROSS THE STATE.
AND THEN WE WILL HAVE A RATIONAL
ENERGY PLAN THAT PRODUCES MORE
ELECTRICITY AND WE WILL ONCE
AGAIN BECOME AN EXPOVERTIER OF
ELECTRICITY.
WE ONCE WERE 8 YEARS AGO.
TODAY WE HAVE TO IMPORT IT AND
WE ARE PAYING THROUGHOUT THE
NOSE.
&gt;&gt; Steve: OKAY.
JACK.
&gt;&gt; THAT&#39;S GOOD.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Steve: BACK HERE MARY HAS
BEEN HERE SINCE THE VERY
BEGINNING.
MARY, SCOOT OVER A LITTLE BIT.
I&#39;M COMING IN.
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT&#39;S YOUR QUESTION FOR JACK?
&gt;&gt; WHAT WILL YOU DO ABOUT THE
HIGH TAXES IN THE STATE OF NEW
JERSEY?
JACK, I HAVE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT
THIS BEFORE.
PROPERTY TAXES IN NEW JERSEY ARE
THROUGH THE ROOF.
&gt;&gt; STEVE, IT&#39;S TAXES ACROSS THE
BOARD AND MY OPPONENT HAS BEEN
LYING ABOUT MY POSITIONS.
WE ARE NOT RAISING ANY TAXES.
I HAVE A VERY SPECIFIC PLAN TO
LOWER INCOME TAXES AND PROPERTY
TAXES HERE IN NEW JERSEY.
WE ALL KNOW WHEN YOU ADD IT ALL
UP, NEW JERSIANS FACE THE
HIGHEST OVERALL TAX BURDEN IN
THE COUNTRY.
PARTICULARLY THE PROPERTY TAX.
VERY, VERY SPECIFIC PLAN WITH A
NEW SCHOOL FUNDING FORMULA TO
LOWER PROPERTY TAXES AND PUT
OTHER REFORMS THIS PLACE TO MAKE
IT EASIER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO
GET A START AND ELDERLY TO LIVE
OUT THEIR LIVES IN HOMES IN
WHICH THEY RAISED THEIR
FAMILIES.
&gt;&gt; Steve: ALL RIGHT.
SOUNDS GOOD.
MARY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[APPLAUSE]
THANK YOU, MARY.
MARY HAS BEEN HERE SINCE THE
BEGINNING.
JACK, AS YOU KNOW, THE VEGAS
DINER IS HERE IN NORTH WILDWOOD,
NEW JERSEY AND WE HAVE GOT THE
MAYOR, PATRICK IS HERE.
&gt;&gt; GOOD MORNING.
[CHEERS]
AND THE CHAIRMAN.
CHAIRMAN OF THE STATE G.O.P.
MIKE DONE HA HUE.
&gt;&gt; Steve: YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD
QUESTION.
WE ARE PRETTY MUCH THE SOUTHERN
MOST POINT OF THE JERSEY SHORE.
&gt;&gt; YES, WE ARE.
JACK, AS YOU KNOW, FOR 10 YEARS,
THE CITY OF NORTH POLL LADDER A
BEACH REPLENISHMENT PROJECT DONE
AND WE HAVE BEEN STYMIED BY THE
DEP.
AS GOVERNOR, WHAT WILL YOU DO TO
BREAKTHROUGH BUREAUCRATIC LOG
JAMS TO GET REALLY IMPORTANT
PROJECTS LIKE THIS COMPLETE?
&gt;&gt; FIRST, GUYS, LET ME SAY ONE
OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN ME AND MY OPPONENT I
KNOW WHERE CAPE MAY IS AND I
KNOW WHAT THE JERSEY SHORE IN
CAPE MAY MEANS TO OUR STATE OF
ECONOMY.
YOU HAVE BEEN SPENDING A LOT OF
MONEY IN TRENTON AND NOT GETTING
RETURN ON INVESTMENT.
THE JERSEY SHORE ECONOMY IS A
CRITICAL COMPONENT OF OUR STATE
ECONOMY.
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET YOU
THE ANSWER RIGHT AWAY IN TERMS
OF HOW TO REFILL THAT BEACH
REPLENISHMENT PROJECT PROMISE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEE YOU MAYOR
THIS AFTERNOON AND DO YOU,
MR. DONAHUE.
STEVE ALL RIGHT.
VERY NICELY DONE.
&gt;&gt; THANKS.
&gt;&gt; Steve: GREAT QUESTION,
PATRICK.
LISTEN, THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR
LAST APPEARANCE.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH FOR GETTING UP SO
EARLY HERE AT THE VEGAS DINER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
&gt;&gt; Steve: JACK, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH AND LAWRENCE, AINSLEY, BACK
TO YOU IN NEW YORK.
