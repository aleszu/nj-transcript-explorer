That is why, ladies and gentlemen, we
need Mikey Cheryl as our next governor.
&gt;&gt; So, without further ado, ladies and
gentlemen, the one and only
Monter New Jersey own Mikey Cheryl.
Wow.
Wow.
This is amazing.
&gt;&gt; I got to tell you, there is no better
place to do a no kings rally than the
people&#39;s republic of Montlair.
&gt;&gt; It is great to see everybody here. You
know, as I go up and down the state and
we think about what this means, I hear
again and again and again.
I want to create opportunity
for my friends, for my family, for my
kids, for their kids. I want to make
sure we all have a shot because this
president is running a worldwide
extortion racket and putting billions of
dollars in his pocket.
Not here, not in New Jersey. Because I
got to tell you, at every step of the
way, I have seen this country create
opportunity.
I&#39;ve seen it on my mom&#39;s side of the
family. You know what? My grandpa&#39;s
family lost everything in the Great
Depression.
&gt;&gt; His dad lost his job. He lost his house.
They moved back to the farm. And yet
after the war, my grandpa got a good
union job.
&gt;&gt; And with that job, he was able to raise
his eight kids. And when he got sick, he
had benefits. He didn&#39;t put our family
back into poverty. But it didn&#39;t end
there because I saw it on my dad&#39;s side
of the family. He grew up poor in West
Virginia. By the time he was 13, both of
his parents had died. And yet he was
able to work hard and to put himself
through college and he didn&#39;t have debt
for decades. So he helped get my family
into the middle class. But it didn&#39;t end
there because I have seen it in my own
life. When I went to my dad, I said,
&quot;You know what?&quot; I was in the fifth
grade. I said, &quot;I want to be a Navy
pilot. I want to go to the Naval
Academy.&quot; And you know what my dad said?
He said, &quot;Mikey, I don&#39;t actually think
the Naval Academy takes women.&quot;
He said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if the Navy has
women pilots,
but I knew that in this country, we
create opportunity. We don&#39;t shut it
down.&quot;
&gt;&gt; And so, I graduated in the first class
of women from the Naval Academy eligible
and shifts in.
&gt;&gt; So even in my own life, I&#39;ve seen
opportunity. And I am telling you, and
by the way, look around. There are
thousands of people out here today. I am
telling you that every single person
here today has a story about how in this
country their family had access to
opportunity that they wouldn&#39;t have
found anywhere else in the world or how
they had opportunity that their mom or
their grandma never would have dreamed
of.
That&#39;s what we&#39;ve created. And it is so
iconic to this country that we know it
the world over as the American dream.
That is what I&#39;m fighting to preserve
here in New Jersey. That is why I&#39;m
running for governor.
And so I hear from people again and
again, if I&#39;m going to have access to
opportunity, if I&#39;m going to make it
here, you&#39;ve got to drive my cost down.
And so that&#39;s why on day one I&#39;m
declaring a state of emergency on
utility costs. I&#39;m freezing rate hikes
on day one.
And I hear from people it&#39;s too
expensive housing
rent rental prices. So I am going after
people who are colluding to raise rental
prices. I&#39;m going to open up grants for
firsttime home buyers so you can create
opportunity. You can create generational
wealth for your families. I&#39;m going to
take on those PBMs, those middlemen,
because people are telling you, Mikey,
sometimes I can&#39;t pay for both my
prescription drugs and my family&#39;s
grocery bills. So, we&#39;re going to take
on PBM&#39;s middlemen, raising prescription
drug costs so we can drive them down.
So, whether it&#39;s utility cuts, housing
costs, healthcare cuts, we are going to
drive down costs here in New Jersey for
families.
Woo.
&gt;&gt; But it doesn&#39;t end at the border of New
Jersey because we know it&#39;s coming from
Washington.
We know at every level this president is
raising costs on people. So whether it&#39;s
that tariff
&gt;&gt; regime
&gt;&gt; where he&#39;s pocketing billions while the
people of New Jersey pay higher costs on
everything from the cup of coffee in the
morning to the groceries
in the afternoon
at every level going up small businesses
going out of business big businesses not
hiring
or whether it&#39;s that one big beautiful
bill. What is so beautiful?
What is so beautiful about not providing
food for hungry kids?
&gt;&gt; Nothing.
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s not who we are.
That&#39;s not New Jersey.
And then
saying he&#39;s going to terminate
the Gateway Tunnel project.
That could mean almost a 100,000 jobs
for families. That&#39;s how we create
opportunity,
not cutting that out. So, at every turn,
we are facing a country where we in New
Jersey are trying to open up
opportunity. But we&#39;ve got a guy in
Washington, DC that thinks he&#39;s going to
reap all of the benefits of being in
charge.
We&#39;re going to fight it.
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re going to fight it too for now.
&gt;&gt; So, I know the fact that you&#39;re here
today
means you have either voted or you have
a plan to vote. Am I right?
&gt;&gt; I thought so.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; And look around. We got a lot of people
here.
&gt;&gt; But we got to get more people out to
vote. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I want each and every one of you
&gt;&gt; to think about five people,
&gt;&gt; five people that you can check in with.
Make sure they got a plan to vote. Make
sure they have a ride to the polls if
they need it. Make sure they know about
early voting and where their polling
place is. Make sure they are voting
because together we are going to prove
something because I want to tell you one
final thing.
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s that?
&gt;&gt; New Jersey
is not a red state.
&gt;&gt; New Jersey
is not a purple state.
&gt;&gt; New Jersey is a blue state.
&gt;&gt; So when we vote, we win. When we vote,
&gt;&gt; when we vote, we win.
&gt;&gt; So let&#39;s find New Jersey. Thank you so
much.
My day by day by day by day by day by
day by day by day by the dawn early
light.
What so proudly
we held
at the twilight
last gleaming. Over the ramp parts we
watched
were so gallently
streaming
and the rockets
red
the bombs bursting
in air
gave proof through the night
that our flag was still there.
And oh say
does that star spangled
ber
yet wave
over the land of
the free
and the Oh
Wow.
