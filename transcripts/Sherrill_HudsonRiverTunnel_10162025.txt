Thank you. Um, I really want to thank
everybody who is here. Thank you to our
county executive Craig Guy, Senator
McCie, who we just heard from, Mayor
Mandelle, Mayor Ganelli, Assemblyman
Rodriguez, Councilwoman Trangali,
Laborers, Vice President, Eastern
Regional Manager Mike Helstrom, Jamie
Morrison, and I think we just saw John
Bartlett, Commissioner John Bartlett,
who&#39;s been so instrumental in transit
here, and I saw Sue Altman, who is here
representing Senator Kim. So, it&#39;s
wonderful to see this support as we
fight for something so important to New
Jersey as the Gateway Tunnel Project.
Um, and I&#39;ll tell you, yes, I&#39;m very
proud, as you probably noticed, of that
moniker, the tunnel obsessed
congresswoman because this is something
that I have fought for from day one. And
we remember the battle days. We remember
the first Trump administration when he
held infrastructure week seemingly every
single week and yet got nothing done and
did not fund this project. So to get the
federal share was such an
accomplishment. And to see how this
could so improve our region, especially
after summer of hell after summer of
hell after summer of hell. And so you
also heard today what an impact this
will have on quality of life. And look,
that&#39;s why I&#39;m running for governor, to
fight for New Jerseyians, to make their
lives better. And this project does just
that. If we don&#39;t fund this project, if
we continue to rely on two
hundredyear-old tunnels, which were
damaged further in Supertorm Sandy, I
have been in them. I can tell you
exactly why we need this tunnel in the
most heavily traffked rail in the United
States and an area of the country
responsible for 20% of the nation&#39;s GDP.
This is critical. This is critical and
it&#39;s critical to the economy of the
United States, but it&#39;s also critical to
the men and women who commute every
single day because without these
improvements, it means continuing to
miss dinner, to miss soccer games, to
not be able to coach teams, to not get
time with your family. It&#39;s a quality of
life issue day after day after day. And
really what I remember when my kids were
young most uh anxietyinducing it means
not getting home in time to pick your
kid up from daycare and trying to figure
out who can do that as you&#39;re madly
trying to get home. So this is a huge
quality of life issue which is the main
reason I fight so hard for it. So look
this tunnel project can be responsible
for almost a 100,000
jobs in the region. That&#39;s what&#39;s at
stake. If we see delays on this, it&#39;s a
million dollars a day we&#39;ll be paying.
And then should the president illegally
be able to stop funding until we can
clot back, then that is going to raise
prices because his tariffs are raising
cost on everything. And so once we get
shovels back in the ground after any
delay, the price will only go up. So
that&#39;s why we&#39;re here today to remind
people of how important this is to push
back against this idea that we should in
any way freeze it or that the president
has the power to terminate it. And I
think it&#39;s also worth noting that my
opponent has given this president an A.
That was after he said he was freezing
the funds. He has said this isn&#39;t a New
Jersey problem. Well, I&#39;m sure the
almost 200,000 New Jerseyians a day who
take this tunnel would disagree with
that assessment. He says he doesn&#39;t hear
anything about it. Well, that&#39;s willful
ignorance because I can tell you we are
all talking about it because this is a
huge economic impact and a quality of
life impact. So, the choice is clear.
I&#39;m fighting for the people of New
Jersey. He&#39;s fighting to excuse Trump.
It&#39;s unacceptable. And that&#39;s why uh I
will continue this fight to make sure I
always focus on the people of New Jersey
making their lives better and making our
economy stronger. So thank you. With
that, I&#39;ll turn it over to questions.
Have you got any
about whe
&gt;&gt; we haven&#39;t gotten any more information,
but the 18 billion would include Gateway
and the the subway that he says he&#39;s
terminating.
&gt;&gt; So, I mean, that&#39;s rich, right? Because
here is somebody who&#39;s tried to excuse
it in every turn. Not till I&#39;ve held him
accountable and his backs basically to
the wall that he gives this kind of milk
toast. Oh yeah, I&#39;ll fight for it. In
what way? In what way is he going to
fight for it? He&#39;s not here today. He&#39;s
not pledging it in front of the trade
union. So I find it uh really
interesting that the only time he fights
for the people of New Jersey is when his
backs to the wall and I hold him
accountable.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman, the president says a lot
of put a lot of initiatives out there. A
lot of them were challenged in the court
not and any no details on how he could
do this saying that it&#39;s going to be
terminated. He is the president, but how
seriously do you take him saying that
with no, you know, details about how it
could happen.
&gt;&gt; Well, I think this is why this race for
governor is so important because in
order to get good results for people,
you have to fight back. You have to be
willing to go toe-to-toe. You have to be
willing to have your AG take him to
court. My opponent has pledged never to
take the administration to court. He
said he agrees with everything the
president does. So if we are going to
back the president down from from this
assertion, if we are going to make sure
we receive those funds that Congress has
allocated to us, then we got to fight
for them. We can&#39;t take a back seat
here. And so that&#39;s what strong
leadership means in these times. And
that&#39;s why this race for governor is so
important here in New Jersey.
question.
&gt;&gt; No, I have not.
process.
&gt;&gt; Um, I would stabilize and modernize it,
making sure we don&#39;t have the swings
year-over-year and then modernize. We
haven&#39;t updated the formula uh in many
years now. So, I would modernize that as
well for students with disabilities. Um,
can we we&#39;ll just stick to on topic
questions um until we get through those.
He&#39;s saying he&#39;ll freeze funding. So the
reason work is continuing now is because
we still have some funding left. But
once that runs out, uh which would be in
a matter of months, then we start to pay
a million dollars a day. We have a barge
we&#39;re renting. We&#39;ve got shovels in the
ground. If we have this stop work order,
it&#39;s going to cost us about a million a
day. And that&#39;s until we start to get
the lawsuits in for work delays. So
it&#39;ll be very expensive uh should should
he be able to carry this out.
&gt;&gt; Congressman
shut down. What is your expectation of
leadership Congress that this is in fact
a negotiating measure by the president
in response to the termination of
you know I I don&#39;t think a negotiating
posture can be illegally taking money
that Congress has appropriated. So
shutdown or not, Congress needs to fight
tooth and nail um because this is an
area where they have acted and they
should not give away power like this.
Yeah, I mean I think you bring up a
really good point. Uh Jack Chidarelli&#39;s
voted against uh infrastructure funding
about six times. he was there uh to
support ending the Ark Tunnel project
which we would have already almost been
complete on that if not complete and uh
he has also said that he&#39;s going to take
a look at a lot of the transit lines and
and cancel them. Um so we see somebody
who&#39;s moving away from public transit. I
am in favor of public transit especially
in the state which so needs it for so
many different reasons. Um, but I, you
know, I think when you say what can be
done, I mean, we&#39;ve,
we&#39;ve basically allocated all the
federal share in Congress. And so now we
see an out-of-crol president just at his
whim saying he&#39;s going to cancel it. We
are going to stand up and fight for that
because um he should have no path
forward for that. And and this is what
we&#39;re fighting for in this country right
now is to make sure that we have a
president who has to follow the law.
When Congress acts as a branch of
government and allocates this money,
that should be the end of it. Um so
we&#39;ll fight to get that money back. Is
there anything you can do right now as a
candidate or should the Murphy
administration be doing right now going
to court for instance?
&gt;&gt; You know, um should as you&#39;ve heard,
he&#39;s made these bold statements. Um we
need to see the actions and then I think
we should immediately be in court to
counter them. And I think that&#39;s why
we&#39;re here today because to uh back the
administration away from this, I think
um I think there has to be an outcry so
that people realize it&#39;s not going to go
unnoticed. I think it&#39;s going to lose
Jack the election. Uh and I I hope that
says something about how this state is
going to move forward and the demands
we&#39;re going to make for this money.
&gt;&gt; Question.
When does the money run out? several
months got
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve heard three or four months.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean I we we&#39;ve heard that uh
Gateway Development Corporation probably
has about 45 days of funding on hand
right now. Um so but if they don&#39;t
continue to get those reimbursements as
they are scheduled to get um they&#39;ll run
out of funding and the minute they run
out of funding it puts this project in
peril. Uh, and look, contracts have been
signed already. And when in the
construction business, when you&#39;re
signing contractors with big general
contractors who put a lot on the line
from their own bonding capacity and the
like and have really mobilized to start
to do these projects, you&#39;re putting a
lot at risk. We know we&#39;re putting at
risk with the tunnel, but you&#39;re also
putting massive long-term business
ventures at risk as well.
&gt;&gt; What does tell you
You know, I I think right now we&#39;re all
um looking to see how this would be
enacted. There&#39;s, like I said, bold
statements. There&#39;s not movement yet on
exactly what this means in practice.
&gt;&gt; President Governor Murphy has signal,
you know, some sort of willingness to
work with. Do you have that? I mean,
you&#39;re you&#39;re going to fight and you
know you are willing to sue the
president over something like this but
are you willing to also sit down and
negotiate with him as
&gt;&gt; you know I think if you are going to
work with this president you have to
come of a strong stance of advocating
for your state and what you want to see
and then you can negotiate I mean my
opponent gives up before the
negotiations start he starts from a
position of whatever you want we&#39;ll do
that&#39;s not leverage That&#39;s not
negotiation. I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s
anything that&#39;s a little more telling
about the kind of power Jack Chidarelli
would have with the president than the
fact that 19 days until his election,
the president&#39;s punched him in the face
like this. That&#39;s pretty telling.
&gt;&gt; The FDA described when I talked last
year, they described a full agreement as
a binding contract that can only be
broken if one of the partners fails to
What will Congress do the delegation do
to enforce this contract?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think we&#39;re um we&#39;re probably
going to need the courts to enforce the
contract. Um we&#39;re in the minority in
Congress, so we will advocate strongly
for it. We will bring on people as as
many people as we can build out, but I
think um the majority, the GOP majority
in Congress has been largely unwilling
to take on the president. So hopefully
we could see some changes. But I also
think uh that this would be something
we&#39;d fight out in court should he try to
enact this. Thank you. Thank you all so
much. I appreciate it.

Hello.
How are you?
Yeah. I mean, look, I think you know
this project being that
the biggest United States

um but they have a certain amount
of reimbursement and they submit records
back to the United States Department of

So,
how do you build? We see it in 2008 in
New York City when the recession
happened. We seen building construction
stopping. You see empty on the ground
when you take out of the system
and just freely threaten
right now. There&#39;s still work that&#39;s
going on on both sides of the river and
in the media.
But this development corporation
