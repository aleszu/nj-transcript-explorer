Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl, it&#39;s in a
pitch battle to succeed Governor Phil
Murphy,
when you look at the polls and what
people are telling us, affordability is
really the key issue for everybody in
the state. I know you&#39;ve been um talking
a lot about it. One of the things you&#39;ve
talked about is univers universal
healthcare or child care for I&#39;m sorry,
child care. And I&#39;m wondering, you know,
you I know that from reading about it,
you want to limit people&#39;s exposure to
about 7% of their income. Is that doable
given the fact that you&#39;re calling on
the federal government to provide the
funds for childare?
&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;ll continue to work with our
federal delegation to push for federal
funding. Right now, what we&#39;re doing in
New Jersey is uh working on prek
throughout the state because we know
those first five years of a child&#39;s life
are some of the times when they learn
the most. And so setting them up well
for school is so important and can
provide such a boost to students as they
start their career in kindergarten. Uh
but that also means that we&#39;re going to
have to push in more services for
infants and um toddlers because that
kind of upends the model we have now
because right now infantbased child care
is more expensive than instate college
tuition. And so too many families are
having to make this choice between can
they work or not.
&gt;&gt; But see right now the federal aid to to
child care is really limited to
lowincome people. I&#39;m wondering if in
your child care plan you would have an
income uh cap as to who could get free
child care or aid in childare
&gt;&gt; at the federal level. What I&#39;ve been
pushing for is to make sure it&#39;s
available to everyone and it&#39;s
percentage based on your income. So of
course if you make more money there is a
higher cost to it
&gt;&gt; and it would be a 7% cap. But at the
same time, what I think we have to come
to terms with, and I hear it about it
from chambers of commerce and businesses
all the time, is this is a key economic
driver right now.
&gt;&gt; Well, people say they can it&#39;s better
easier for them to go to work if they
have if they have childare,
&gt;&gt; right? And too many parents are finding
the high cost of child care preventing
them from going into the workforce or
having to leave the workforce for a
period of time. And we know that if a
woman leaves the workforce for just five
years, which is that uh birth to
kindergarten time period, that that can
be a 20% hit on her entire income
throughout her life.
&gt;&gt; So I guess I wonder what you make of the
debate that&#39;s going on on this side of
the river about universal child care and
the claim by the leading person in the
polls, Zor Montani, about having
universal child care paid for by the
city government, maybe with some state
aid. Is there any possibility that New
Jersey itself could come up with money
that could fund some form of universal
child care in the state?
&gt;&gt; Well, what the governor&#39;s been working
on right now is that prek, so three and
four year olds uh throughout the state
and making sure that they have uh the
preschool so that they can get a good
start on schools. Now child care earlier
a lot of the program I have would be
incentivizing businesses for example to
uh build out child care through tax
incentives pushing into in certain child
care deserts uh infant-based child care
that we need so mothers can go back to
work or families and parents can go back
to work and then also fixing some of the
ways in which the workforce is able to
get their credits because right now you
have to work pay for your credits. Uh, I
would like to see some on the job
training so you can be earning money as
you&#39;re earning your credits.
&gt;&gt; So, you&#39;re basically saying though that
you don&#39;t think that the federal
government, given the present climate in
Washington, would look favorably on
giving uh an increase in federal aid for
child care, especially in a blue state
like New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; You know, we don&#39;t see signs of that. We
see such mismanagement at the federal
level. I think uh we&#39;ve added another
trillion to the deficit in the um the
most rapid pace that we&#39;ve ever seen in
the nation&#39;s history. Um so we see the
deficit going up and yet costs going up
for everyone because generally I think
what the president&#39;s doing is running an
economy that benefits him. So I believe
he and his family have made about $5
billion at this point in the short time
he&#39;s been in office while everyone pays
more money. So with that in mind, that
does not seem to be uh a focus of the
Trump administration is actually running
a good economy or investing in working
parents. That is something at the state
level we&#39;re finding ways to do um so
that we can push in so that we can run a
resilient workforce.
&gt;&gt; So basically saying that you could have
universal child care that would be with
a 7% campus right now a wish list
because you don&#39;t think you can get the
federal government to do it. I am hoping
that we can move them that once we win
back the House of Representatives that
we can start to push more on better
economic incentives for the workforce.
Um, right now we have the government
shut down. So the Republican majorities
in the House and the Senate with the
president can&#39;t even keep the government
open. So it&#39;s hard to see them moving
forward on policies that are going to
advance the workforce. You
&gt;&gt; know, you say winning back the House.
How difficult is it going to be? I know
that the the politics in New York are
going to play a role and the president
is looking forward to the possibility
that we&#39;d have a Democratic socialist
mayor in New York City and he hopes to
use that to prevent Democrats from
taking control of the house next
November. How worried are you about the
fact that if there is a Democratic
socialist mayor in New York City, the
president will try to use that and make
him a poster boy for why Democrats
shouldn&#39;t be reelected? So, I&#39;m sure the
president&#39;s going to try to do that, but
I think what we see in uh the two big
statewide races that we have going on
right now, New Jersey, uh my home state
and Virginia, um we see uh you know, the
electorate really wanting to have um
good governance, efficient government,
driving down costs, taking on the
economic attacks from Washington. I
think that&#39;s where we see um large
electorates. New York City is a little
different from maybe the electorate as a
whole. And I think what we&#39;re seeing in
New Jersey and Virginia is just a real
desire to drive down cost and to take on
the economic attacks from Washington.
&gt;&gt; So, how difficult would it be for you to
be elected to deal with um a White House
that has already shown that they um
would like to punish blue states. You&#39;ve
seen it happen with Gateway. You&#39;ve seen
it happen with a number of things. Are
you how will you forge a working
relationship with the president at the
if you get elected?
&gt;&gt; You know, I think what we&#39;ve seen is
it&#39;s not just blue states. I mean, he is
whole scale wrecking the economy of the
United States of America. So, I have
seen it in students who are coming
forward and saying, um, you know, I had
a job offer. I was talking to an
astrophysicist who said, I had a job
offer and that has been rescended. We&#39;re
seeing it the hundreds of thousands jobs
are drying up because jobs are drying
up. Um and and this is across the
country.
&gt;&gt; Are you blaming tariffs or you just
blaming economic policy?
&gt;&gt; Uh it&#39;s sort of uh it it&#39;s the tariffs
certainly. So um I was talking to Chuck,
a coffee store owner who was telling me
that a bag of coffee beans cost him
about $2.50 until Trump, as he put it,
got in a fight with the president of
Brazil. Um, and then the bag of beans
went up to about $657.
He&#39;s not sure if his clients are going
to take that on. So that imperils his
small business. Big businesses who were
just over a year ago before Trump got
into office contemplating expanding. Um,
they were telling me they were going to
need a bigger workforce now contracting
and laying people off. So we&#39;re seeing
that going on. We&#39;re also seeing then,
you know, the specific hits like you
were describing with the gateway tunnel
that can be responsible for over or
about a 100,000 jobs in the region. So
that&#39;s a huge economic hit. So at every
turn you see the president destroying
the economy.
&gt;&gt; Do you think that there&#39;s any
possibility that once the government
shutdown ends that the president will
have second thoughts about terminating
Gateway? Well, um, my intention is to
have him in court right away to give him
second thoughts about it because that is
congressionally appropriated money that
he should not be able to freeze.
&gt;&gt; But why are you waiting? Why don&#39;t you
go in now?
&gt;&gt; Um, I&#39;m not the governor yet.
&gt;&gt; Ah, good point.
&gt;&gt; So, in other words, you&#39;re saying that
the minute
&gt;&gt; my attorney general,
&gt;&gt; the minute you you get into power, if
you win, what&#39;s going to be one of the
first things you try to do?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. because you have been called
the tunnel obsess obsessive
congresswoman. Why why is this so
important to you?
&gt;&gt; Well, because it is the biggest program
of national significance. As I
mentioned, it&#39;s responsible for about
100,000 jobs in the region. Um the
Northeast Corridor is responsible for
about 20% of the nation&#39;s GDP. So, this
is a national issue. And we also know
that about 200,000 New Jerseyians take
that tunnel every single day. And it&#39;s
personal. My husband&#39;s one of them. So
really making sure New Jerseyians don&#39;t
face that summer of hell year after year
after year is critically important. But
it also we have got to build out
transportation across the state. And so
if we are going to come up with the
money to do that, we can&#39;t have this
federal share share withdrawn um for the
gateway tunnel.
&gt;&gt; Well, we&#39;re going to have I want to talk
to you more about it, but we&#39;re going to
leave it right here for now. We&#39;ll be
right back with more with Mikey Cheryl.
We are back with Congresswoman Mikey
Cheryl. I want to continue talking about
transit. I know one of the big concerns
in this part of the state is NJ Transit
and the terrible service that people
feel they&#39;re getting. How would you
improve it?
&gt;&gt; So, yes, you are referring to what we in
New Jersey call the summer of hell. Um,
we&#39;re on about our
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s the winter of hell, the spring of
hell.
Summer has gotten worse on the heavy
rail lines. So the New Jersey Transit
and we use the Amtrak lines because uh
we&#39;ve had catary wire problems because
Amtrak hasn&#39;t kept up their rail. So I
immediately started to demand that they
do. So we got 300 million to invest
federally in the that rail um so they
could fix the catary wires and yet now
we&#39;re having path problems and that&#39;s a
port authority issue. So I&#39;ll demand the
port authority make better investments
in path.
&gt;&gt; I see. It seems to me though that I want
I&#39;ve always wondered about why you fund
NJ Transit from the New Jersey general
fund and from the budget. If you take a
look at the MTA, the MTA funds its its
programs through a whole basket of taxes
from a quarter% of the sales tax, the
mortgage recording tax, the stock
transfer tax, a gas tax, lots of taxes.
They have lots of taxes. Why doesn&#39;t New
Jersey do that? Because then you would
come up with more money to fix NJ
Transit. I mean, it&#39;s not just the
rails. People complain about the cars.
People complain about the service, how
fast it is, how many trains run. It goes
on and on and on.
&gt;&gt; And it used to be the best of the three.
New Jersey Transit. Unfortunately, it&#39;s
been a minute. Um, certainly not
recently. And you&#39;re exactly right. We
need a dedicated source of funding.
&gt;&gt; I mean, why don&#39;t you copy what the MTA
does? There&#39;s like tons of taxes. I
mean, you know, in New York, they pay 8
and 3/4% taxes in sales tax. a quarter
percent goes to the MTA. That&#39;s a lot of
money. Why doesn&#39;t New Jersey do
something like that?
&gt;&gt; So, New Jersey has really, I think,
strained the taxation si system to its
breaking point. We have the highest
corporate taxes in the nation right now.
Um, simply looking to fair hikes in
taxes is just not an option.
&gt;&gt; So, how are you going to find money for
NJ Transit? So many places around the
world that run some of the best transit
systems worldwide do it through things
like transit oriented development,
developing properties they have, putting
parking lots on them, other leasable
facilities, um putting advertising on
the side of buses and trains, putting
even I was speaking to a woman from
South Korea who was saying, Mikey, you
know, in South Korea there&#39;s TVs on the
buses so that you can do the advertising
that way maybe like you see in the
taxis. So we have a lot of options.
&gt;&gt; I have to ask you this question. Who
would want to put their sign on the side
of an NJ Transit train? I mean,
seriously,
&gt;&gt; we&#39;ve already seen several of I so I I
think it&#39;s awesome because I mean, I
hate to say this, but often as you&#39;re
taking a train, you find yourself in
traffic, which is something else I want
to address, but in the meantime, so
you&#39;re a captive audience. As you&#39;re
sitting there, there&#39;s the bus, there&#39;s
the advertising. It&#39;s actually, I think,
a really great way to advertise in this
area.
&gt;&gt; And you also you also think you would do
televisions. I love that idea. Um, and
we see those in like taxi cabs now. So,
when you have that kind of captive
audience, having advertising can be
really lucrative. So, I know another one
of your signature issues is to freeze
electric rates, which have gone up 20%
in the last year in New Jersey, but a
lot of people think you can&#39;t do it. A
lot of people say it&#39;s unconstitutional,
that you&#39;re going to have problems doing
it, especially since the power companies
are private entities. How are you going
to get a privatelyun for-profit company
say, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to reduce the
rates.&quot;
&gt;&gt; So, this is something no other governor
has done. I am going to declare a state
of emergency on utility costs because we
are at the breaking point and the people
of New Jersey are demanding, look, we
need to address this immediately. Not in
10 years, not in a 5-year plan, but
immediately. And yeah, I think my
opponent immediately attacked it because
he has no plan to do anything about it.
But I&#39;ll tell you when I said that, the
utility companies put an open letter out
saying that they do want to negotiate
these prices with me, that they&#39;re
interested in doing just that. We also
have money coming in through the BPU um
that we can use to defay some of these
costs. But then at the same time, I&#39;m
going to drive massive amounts of power
into the grid because right now we are
in a market um New York&#39;s in it as well
and the market prices are very very
expensive. How do you where do you get
the power the power from? I mean, is it
nuclear? Is it wind that the president
hates? Is it going to be more power
coming from the grid? What?
&gt;&gt; So, the fastest and cheapest um way we
can start to add power to the grid is
solar and battery storage. So, I&#39;m
immediately going to get to work with
the legislature to cut through the red
tape and permitting issues that have
long plagued this area so that we can
put solar on capped landfills, on
rooftops, getting uh battery storage in
those areas where we have good
interconnectivity to immediately add it
to the grid. And then, um in the first
budget, start to put money towards
modernizing our natural gas facilities
so that we can drive up production and
drive down carbon across the state. and
then as a longer term plan have nuclear
um and we have several areas where we
have traditionally had nuclear uh where
the communities are comfortable with
that so we can drive that into the grid
as well.
&gt;&gt; What do you think of the the proposal by
Assemblywoman uh Katz who&#39;s proposed um
taking a look at those data centers that
use a lot of power and maybe giving them
a search charge? You know, I was
actually just talking about this this
morning um with several policy leaders
in the state because we do have to come
up with a plan and I&#39;m going to actually
take a close look at that piece of
legislation probably not in the next 12
days because that&#39;s the final days of my
election. But I was just discussing that
actual piece of legislation because we
see part of the reason the market is so
expensive is because Virginia has put in
a ton of data centers and that is
sucking a lot of power out of our grid
making it very expensive. At the same
time though, New Jersey is an innovation
state. We have always been a leader in
innovation and we want to continue to
grow that as well. So we&#39;re going to
have to find a balance.
&gt;&gt; So data isn&#39;t the only concern that
people have. People are also concerned
about online safety. I wonder what you
plan to do about that. I mean, it&#39;s sort
of intertwined, but seriously, a lot of
people are concerned about about
hacking, about whether their data is
safe. Every day you have somebody
complaining about I got a letter from X
company that said that they hacked in
and they have my my
&gt;&gt; I hear this concern all the time. In
fact, seniors have been coming to me um
because Doge released a lot of social
security information. So, seniors are
very concerned. and they&#39;re often the
targets of data collection and attacks.
Um, I&#39;ve also heard from governors who
have said that the president has
demanded some of their uh election
information which includes things like
uh driver&#39;s license information and
addresses, social security numbers. And
then of course my opponent was involved
in a a breach of my private military
data which he received illegally from
the president&#39;s administration and then
gave to a journalist of all things. So,
um we are seeing this at every level,
which is why it&#39;s so important. Um well,
I&#39;m going to um both protect people&#39;s
data. I will like several governors I&#39;ve
spoken to tell the president no when he
tries to get into all of our state data.
I&#39;ll protect it for the people here. But
it&#39;s also um it&#39;s a little bit broader
than that as far as what I&#39;m looking at.
I&#39;m gonna pass the kids online safety
agenda that will protect our kids online
as well because we see with these
algorithms um that they are pushing kids
into some very bad places for mental
health. We&#39;ve seen testimony in the
Senate about the horrible things
children see um sometimes before they
die by suicide and their parents
testifying to that. So, we&#39;re also going
to have a center of excellence because
right now the people that hold a lot of
this data are the big tech companies. So
in New Jersey, we are going to develop a
center for this data so we can better
act in this space and I think be a real
leader in this space for our kids.
&gt;&gt; So we have about 30 seconds left. Is
there anything else you&#39;d like to say
about whether what you can actually do
to accomplish in the short term in terms
of that 15 seconds now?
&gt;&gt; Yes. In the short term um it will be
driving down electricity costs. Also, um
I&#39;m going to build a a database so that
we can cut through red tape and
permitting and small businesses can see
where their permit is so they can make
better plans and then hold hands uh with
a business action center.
&gt;&gt; And on that note, we&#39;re going to have to
leave it right there for now, but our
conversation continues right after the
show on our streaming channel CBS News
New York.
[Music]
New Jersey voters have a lot on their
minds and they have lots of questions
for the woman who wants to move into the
governor&#39;s mansion. So, we&#39;re going to
start and you&#39;re going to hear the
question and then you can answer. So,
Colin from Hoboken says the cost of
housing is out of control. Let&#39;s take a
listen. My question would be how you
plan on dealing with the constant
increase in housing prices and the tax
burden that that takes for the property
taxes cuz a lot of people like live
their whole life in a town. You raise
their kids there and then they&#39;re forced
to move when they have to retire or you
don&#39;t move to that town until your first
kid is 5 years old and you basically
only get to like you own there but
you&#39;re technically kind of just renting
there because you can&#39;t afford the tax
bill once your kids are out of school.
So, Colin wants to know if you can do
anything about high housing costs and
property taxes.
&gt;&gt; Colin has really narrowed in on exactly
what I hear as I go across the state.
Um, how unaffordable New Jersey is and
people, you know, the first place they
focus on is often housing costs, rental
cost, and property taxes. So, as far as
housing, I&#39;m going to beef up the
first-time home buyers program because
for so many people, I hear from young
people who can&#39;t get into that first
home. They lose bid after bid because
housing prices have gone up by 50% in
the last 5 years. But also, I&#39;m going to
take on those landlords who are
colluding now to raise prices. Um, in
fact, that is one of my opponent&#39;s
biggest donors as somebody who is being
investigated for doing just that. So,
we&#39;ll take on those prices to drive them
down. But at the same time, he&#39;s right.
You get into your home and then property
taxes go up every year. So, I speak to
seniors on a fixed income who are
struggling with just this. They don&#39;t
they don&#39;t want to move out of Jersey.
&gt;&gt; Does this have to do with your plan to
um make schools less expensive by having
&gt;&gt; Well, it&#39;s certainly schools. It&#39;s
certainly the state health benefits plan
which will drive property taxes down. Um
but at the same time for seniors
specifically as he was mentioning it&#39;s
the stay in the anchor programs um so
that we can help people help seniors
stay in their homes.
&gt;&gt; Okay we&#39;re going to stay on the topic of
affordability. Sean from East Orange and
Amy from Scotch Plains have this to say.
&gt;&gt; Mike and Cheryl I would like to know
about affordable housing.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m wondering what your ideas are for
increasing supply and access to
affordable housing for families.
affordable housing for families
&gt;&gt; that I also hear about because at every
level people are just priced out and so
that&#39;s why um we have opportunities to
build more affordable but this is an
area that the state has to take greater
action in because I&#39;ll tell you what
happens now is what&#39;s called builder&#39;s
remedy. So we see so many luxury
apartment buildings going up with just
four or five affordable. So, we need
both market rate to help start to drive
down costs, but then with affordable,
I&#39;ll have state zoning laws so that
people can help uh have ADUs on their
properties. Some of our churches and
faith areas want to build affordable on
their properties. We also have
opportunities in VFWs and um Legion
Halls where they want to build
affordable for vets and I&#39;ve helped on
some of those programs as well. So, in
all these ways addressing both the
affordable housing problem and some of
the market rate housing problems. In
order for them to build the housing
though, are you going to have to give
state grants to help them do it?
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re going to have to both reszone in
some areas and those were the specific
areas I was sort of mentioning on New
York&#39;s doing some of this successfully,
but then you&#39;re going to have to have
some state support for it if you&#39;re not
just going to build a bunch of luxury
apartment buildings.
&gt;&gt; I get it. So, on to families. Harpria
from Hoken has this question. Let&#39;s take
a look.
&gt;&gt; I would like to ask the governor if you
have any provisions for child care. if
you can make child care more affordable
in New Jersey
&gt;&gt; are your favorite issue.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Um so I have four kids and I will
tell you um finding child care was hell.
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a understating it
or overstating it. Um especially with
your first child and you&#39;re kind of you
can&#39;t find a place uh first of all just
finding a place that takes infants is
really really difficult and then if you
can find a place it&#39;s often out of your
price range. In fact, I was often paying
more in child care than I was earning,
which didn&#39;t make sense at the time. I
heard that from my husband several
times. But nevertheless, if I had made a
different choice, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be
in Congress today or running for
governor. So, it really is important
that we help families. It&#39;s a workforce
issue. It totally is. And so, that&#39;s
why, as we were talking about, tax
incentives for businesses that open up
child care centers to help their
employees. um ensuring that we have the
child care workforce and drive costs
down there by helping them work as
they&#39;re earning credits and then as we
um see some of the model being changed
because we have as we&#39;re pushing into
universal prek helping push in supports
for some of those infant centers which
are really needed.
&gt;&gt; So Aiden from Irvington has a question
about what&#39;s going on in Washington.
what is your plan for I guess kind of
warding off any sort of economic impact
from a government shutdown or like
recession or anything like that?
&gt;&gt; To know what you can do to blunt the
economic impact of the shutdown.
&gt;&gt; And that&#39;s the other thing we were sort
of talking about is this economic
devastation that the Trump
administration is creating. Um I often
call the tariff program a worldwide
extortion scheme because as everyone
here is paying more, we see Trump making
$5 billion. We&#39;ve seen the deficit go up
an inordinate amount, over a trillion
dollars in the shortest period of time
ever, and yet we&#39;re still seeing costs
go up. So that is why I will be in
court. Uh we&#39;ve seen success there. Uh
the Trump administration canceled some
Title One funding. We clawed that back,
$200 million. Um so I will take them on
again if they try to freeze this gateway
tunnel money as the president said he&#39;s
going to do because that will be illegal
with Congressional appropriations. And
then at the same time, we&#39;re just to
sort of defay the attacks from
Washington. We&#39;re going to have to make
Trenton function better so we can
continue to drive innovation. Finally,
working with the Northeast Corridor and
um you know, right now we&#39;re seeing
because of RFK Junior&#39;s attacks on
healthcare. Uh there&#39;s a a coalition in
the Northeast of Governors who are
acting together to make sure people can
still have access to vaccines. There is
still good medical data. And I&#39;ve
already heard we have in in both
Massachusetts with Governor Healey and
here in New Jersey, we have um a lot of
the pharmaceutical base, some of them
are saying we&#39;re not sure how we&#39;re
going to get new drugs to market without
the FDA. So, working in conjunction with
the governor so that we can continue to
create uh innovation and new pathways in
our states.
&gt;&gt; Well, having said that about the
president, I think you&#39;re going to be
interested to hear this question. Steve
from New Jersey wants to know this. My
primary question would be the ways that
you plan to stand up to the regime of
Donald Trump.
&gt;&gt; How are you going to stand up to
President Trump?
&gt;&gt; Um so when it comes to for example his
threat to terminate the gateway tunnel,
I will be in court. Um I will join the
tariff lawsuit um immediately along with
the other states who are taking on the
president because this is really
congressional mandate and the president
is usurping authority there. I&#39;ll also
stand up to him in our courts right now.
for example, um he is uh he has um a US
attorney in office that is there
illegally. Um and we see uh an attempt
to do a lot of political prosecution. So
we saw that uh this US attorney went
after the mayor of our largest city and
then when the tapes came out had to
withdraw that but then immediately went
after a sitting member of Congress. So
in all of these ways standing up for the
people of New Jersey against this
administration. But I need to ask you
this question though. Kathy Hokll, the
governor of of New York, has figured
that it&#39;s not always um a good idea to
poke a stick in his eye and she&#39;s tried
to meet with him to try to come to some
find some common ground. Is that
something you would also try?
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m willing to work with anyone when it
comes to f, you know, supporting the
people of New Jersey. Um I&#39;m I&#39;m willing
to work with anyone. I&#39;m also willing to
work to st I&#39;m willing to stand up to
anyone, which I&#39;ve done with even
members of my own party. So, it&#39;s kind
of an and both as I fight for people in
New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And now to Stephen, who&#39;s also
from Jersey City. Take a look.
&gt;&gt; What are you going to do for cannabis in
New Jersey?
&gt;&gt; What do you mean by that?
&gt;&gt; Um, as far as the laws, are they going
to be tampered with? Are they not? Are
regulations going to go up further? Are
they not?
&gt;&gt; So, Steven wants to know about weed.
What are you going to do to change any
of the regulations if you are?
&gt;&gt; Um, everyone in New Jersey wants to see
the laws changed. Um the legislature
feels as if they haven&#39;t um really
gotten the law right there. The cannabis
companies feels as if the law isn&#39;t
right. Um so some of the the kind of
lowhanging fruit is the THC drinks that
are now unregulated and being sold in
7-Elevens. Um ensuring that young kids
don&#39;t have access to cannabis products.
making sure we&#39;re doing better
enforcement because in I&#39;ve heard from
some mayors concerns about in bodeas
very young kids are getting um access to
edibles that look like candy and their
parents don&#39;t realize it&#39;s not and then
at the same time um addressing some of
the homegrow provisions um which I&#39;m
supportive of and then um ensuring that
we have better regulations around
cannabis where it can be sold and in
that way and the reason the cannabis
industry wants it is because they want
to legitimize their process. So,
&gt;&gt; are you satisfied with where the money
is going, the revenue from from um pot
sales is going or would you change maybe
take some of that revenue and use it for
some of the things you want to do like
maybe mass transit or your housing
initiative or your child care
initiative?
&gt;&gt; So, some of the cannabis money was
really supposed to go into more
provisions ensuring that kids didn&#39;t
have access to it. So, um that hasn&#39;t
happened. I&#39;d like to see some of it
going where um the legislation was
saying that it would go to, but then of
course if we can have more revenue to
put into a lot of the programs we want
to see statewide, um I&#39;d welcome that.
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s pretty tanalyzing to use it as a
revenue source. Okay, Rob from Hoboken
has a question about your record.
&gt;&gt; Why didn&#39;t Mikey Cheryl graduate with
her Annapolis class?
&gt;&gt; There you go. So, um I did not uh tell
on some of my classmates and so I didn&#39;t
graduate with my class, but I did get
commissioned. Um and I went on to serve
for almost 10 years in some of the
highest positions of trust and most
recently earned the highest civilian
honor from the Navy for my work on the
Armed Services Committee.
&gt;&gt; Alexis from Hoboka wants to know about
the cost of college.
&gt;&gt; How do you plan on making tuition more
affordable for everybody?
This is really important because we&#39;ve
actually seen a lot of the federal money
being withdrawn from things like PEL
grants um which help a lot of firsttime
college students attend college. We&#39;ve
also seen restrictions on the amount of
federal loans you can take out which is
really impacting our ability to grow the
doctors and the workforce there because
it&#39;s not enough money to complete your
medical degree. And then all of the
attacks on visa holders and coming to
our schools. we had uh grown the best
college and university system in the
world and the president is attacking
that and what that means to
affordability is that many of our
international students paid full freight
and really defayed the cost for US
students. So in all of these ways we are
seeing a tax on affordability in
universities from the federal
government. And so at the state level,
we are looking across the state to
ensure we&#39;re driving in um some of the
state programs so that first-time
college students can have that support
um ensure that we&#39;re still getting
private public private partnerships and
some of the innovation to fund some of
the colleges at the at the graduate
student level as we continue to drive
down costs at the student level and in
New Jersey costs are still far too high
for colleges and universities. Last
question. Andrew from Saddlebrook wants
your thoughts on this.
&gt;&gt; What do you think about the plastic bag
ban?
&gt;&gt; The plastic bag ban.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, um I will tell you I am
fine with some of the um the the brown
bags and the traditional bags, but
plastic bags, if you go in any of our
cities in the winter, you can see trees
just full of plastic bags. Um it they&#39;re
in our waterways. We have plastics in
our waterways. Um, we have them, like I
said, in the trees. So, I am um not a
big fan of plastic bags.
&gt;&gt; So, a question I&#39;d like to ask you
before we end the program is this. Um,
there&#39;s a big concern about the rising
number of anti-semitic incidents in New
Jersey. And I wonder how that relates to
um what seems to be a new sensitivity
and growing sensitivity and and support
for the Palestinian cause at the expense
of of Israel. There seems to be a trend
to be concerned about what happened in
Gaza and to not be so concerned about
what happened on October 7th um in the
attacks on Israel. I wonder where you
come down on that and how you think um
you can change things in New Jersey in
terms of anti-semitic incidents and also
you know the concerns that people are
changing in terms of their sympathy for
Israel. You know, I think there are some
people that see it as an eitheror.
Either you support um ending the famine
in Gaza or you um want to, you know,
you&#39;re appalled at what happened on
October 7th. But that is that is not how
the majority of people see it. I think
in New Jersey, most people see October
7th as the atrocity it was. that uh
sexual assault um torture, hostage
shaking should never be tools of war.
And at the same time, um famine should
never be a tool of war either. So I
think most people are quite comfortable
with both of those things and think the
famine in Gaza needs to be addressed.
And then at home, I think there is also
uh a real concern in in a lot of
communities for anti-semitism and
speaking out. I think that the whole
controversy gave rise to more
anti-semitic incidents.
&gt;&gt; I I think that&#39;s true. I I think we&#39;ve
seen more anti-semitism um throughout
New Jersey. We we saw a growing we saw a
rise in it even before October 7th, but
we&#39;ve certainly seen a huge uptick in
anti-semitism in the aftermath. things
like um uh you know graffiti and spray
paint uh when little kids were in in
Sunday school at a synagogue around me
and then people kind of attacking it. Um
we&#39;ve seen it in some of the online
stuff. I&#39;ve seen horrible online things.
Kids wearing um electric tape like a
Hitler
&gt;&gt; mustache as they&#39;re attacking other kids
and bullying them for being Jewish. I
mean that&#39;s something that I just I&#39;m
I&#39;m shocked. I I really maybe I
shouldn&#39;t be but I am. So addressing
that has been something I have done from
day one um both holding uh roundts with
students and rabbis but then in the
aftermath of some of the testimony on
the hill to bring our colleges and
universities together to say what are
you doing to make students feel safe?
how are you ensuring um that there are
not anti-semitic incidents on your
colleges and universities? And I think
in New Jersey that has been something
taken very seriously. And I&#39;ll tell you,
we&#39;ve often met with presidents of of
colleges and universities so we could um
help them work through a community issue
and continue to meet with um rabbis.
that uh in talking to the Jewish
Federation, and I know this is some of
what they&#39;ve expressed too, is I think
we have to have we we can&#39;t just be
talking to each other. I I can&#39;t just
talk to other rabbis that and we&#39;re in
violent agreement that we want to end
anti-semitism. Um we need to bring a lot
of empathy into this and I think that&#39;s
something um that we&#39;re all working to
do. But I&#39;ll say this, I think is
something that divides my opponent and I
because um I saw uh one of my
supporters, not someone in my inner
circle, but somebody who is um a group
that supported me have somebody that
made some anti-semitic comments and I
called it out and I said it was
unacceptable and called on that person
to be fired. Whereas Jack Chidarelli had
someone who he called somebody in his
inner circle who made anti-semitic
comments and then he led the round of
applause for that person and then still
refuses to call that person out.
&gt;&gt; Do you think also there has to be more
education?
&gt;&gt; I have long been a fan of more
education. Um, I&#39;ve supported some
education in line with um some of uh the
the work with um D-Day events and stuff
like that to talk about the Holocaust
and and send people um to have that
connection there to understand how that
goes. And in New Jersey, we have
Holocaust education. It&#39;s not always um
not all school districts are following
that. So, I do think that&#39;s very
important as well.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl, good luck.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you for joining me and
thank you at home for joining us as
well.
