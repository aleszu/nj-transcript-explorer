All right, welcome back. We are in the
great state of New Jersey and anyway
with Republican candidate for governor
Jack Chidarelli is with us. Joining us
now is a New Jersey resident. She is a
friend and colleague, the anchor of the
Faulner Focus, a co-host of the hit show
Outnumbered right on the Fox News
Channel. Welcome my friend
Harris Faulner.
&gt;&gt; Hey, how are you?
&gt;&gt; So good to see you.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; New Jersey resident and here you are.
Okay. Would you agree with me this man
wins this race and under the tunnel
across the bridge whatever
that&#39;s a political earthquake how do you
juxtapose that
&gt;&gt; you know it is right now because
affordability is such a huge issue and
on the New York side you have a man who
I call a communist he&#39;s a democrat
socialist/communist
mom Donnie who&#39;s preaching free stuff
and what Jack Chidarelli is talking
about is turning our system upside down
and making it work. And so I have a lot
of questions for you tonight. Um, and I
know the audience does as well. But the
big difference is going to be that
you&#39;ll see some of that potentially
happen as you have with other New Jersey
governors who&#39;ve tried, but we got to
get it right. We have to get it right.
We we have a lot at stake in the state
now. Our energy prices are off the
charts. Anecdotally, Harris, I have a
lot of friends in New Jersey, and
anecdotally, they&#39;re telling me all they
see are Jack Chidarelli signs, even in
blue areas of New Jersey,
&gt;&gt; and we we see early voting. Again,
anecdotally, we see that independents
are breaking hard,
&gt;&gt; right,
&gt;&gt; for this candidate. What has changed
here?
&gt;&gt; Well, part of it is that it has such a
blue history. I call New Jersey a cobalt
blue state. It has had some Republicans
along the way, but for the last 24
years, it&#39;s been majority Democrat rule
at the top of the ticket. And I know
Republicans have won races, but it&#39;s
hard to break the back of the drug of
high taxes for the government and for
those officials who traffic in that. And
it feels like they&#39;re trafficking in
high taxes because the current governor
said when he ran the last time, if taxes
aren&#39;t are your issue, then New Jersey
is not for you. I&#39;m sorry. we live here.
And and by the way, in one of the
highest tax states in America, taxes are
everybody&#39;s thing. Even if you&#39;re not
paying hugely high taxes, they&#39;re a part
of your income that is rather sometimes
opaque. You want to see where it&#39;s
going. Maybe your life isn&#39;t getting
better, but you&#39;re paying high taxes.
So, that was an issue that I think the
left, at least in that race, was tone
deaf on. You came close. He outspent
you. But I think we&#39;re in a different
place politically. I I&#39;d like to ask
Jack, if I may, where are we right now
with with not just the tax issue, but
how different the landscape is from the
last time you ran against a Democrat?
&gt;&gt; You know, I always say this, what&#39;s
different this time around? I mean, I&#39;m
talking about the same issues I did back
in 21. They were percolating. They&#39;re at
a complete boil now because people are
pissed over the affordability crisis,
the public safety crisis, the public
education crisis. What&#39;s different is no
pandemic this time around. It was an
easy run for governor when there&#39;s a
shelter in place order. Number two, I&#39;m
not running against an incumbent.
&gt;&gt; Number three, there&#39;s a lot less
indifference this time around. The
closest in my race and how well the
president ran here, you know, from 20 to
24, the president improved by more than
10 points in New Jersey. That was the
greatest improvement of the 50 states.
Now, no, he didn&#39;t win New Jersey, but
that improvement means there&#39;s 300,000
more people today that are favorable to
the president than back in 2020. What do
you make of a quarter of a million
people in this state have fled? They
have left.
&gt;&gt; How can you blame it? It&#39;s the highest
tax state in the nation. We always lead
the nation in out migration. We&#39;re going
to change that. We&#39;re going to downsize
this state government, which is bloated
and inefficient to afford a tax cut for
individuals and businesses.
&gt;&gt; All right, let&#39;s talk about how you do
that. Governor uh Landry of Louisiana I
spent some time with recently. We did a
show together on the banks of
Mississippi at Southern University and
H.B.CU. He and I talked about Doge in
his state. He did that years ago. That&#39;s
kind of what you want to do here.
&gt;&gt; Well, leave it to a CPA. So,
&gt;&gt; we um in New Jersey, we have a committee
for state investigations whose job it is
to identify fraud in state government.
&gt;&gt; The CEO of that committee recently had
to resign for fraud.
&gt;&gt; Welcome to Phil Murphy&#39;s New Jersey. We
also have a state controller whose job
it is to identify waste and
inefficiency. I&#39;m putting the two
together under one order, general, and
that will be the equivalent of a New
Jersey Doge.
&gt;&gt; Can Can I talk to you about the state
controller? I did a little bit of
homework. He says he&#39;s nonpartisan.
That&#39;s critical in this environment.
&gt;&gt; It it is. And it&#39;s a six-year
appointment, so it&#39;s not always in
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re going to keep him.
&gt;&gt; Well, I&#39;m forced to. And when the six
years are up, we&#39;ll give it a close
look.
&gt;&gt; I I don&#39;t know. In this environment with
President Trump, I I don&#39;t know what&#39;s
forced and what&#39;s not when it comes to
keeping people.
&gt;&gt; Well, you know, nationally, peace and
prosperity tend to drive elections,
right? on a state level a little bit
different I would argue and Harris tell
me if you agree law and order safety
security it&#39;s got to be a priority for
local government and obviously taxation
and prosperity and opportunity you know
look at for example Mikey Cheryl says no
I I&#39;m not for defunding the police
that&#39;s what she says I&#39;ll give you an
example she voted no on a 2023 bill to
make assaulting a law enforcement
officer firefighter or first responder.
A deportable offense. Really? She voted
no in a resolution in 23 expressing
support for law local law enforcement
officers and condemning efforts to
defund, dismantle, you know, law and
order. So, it&#39;s like a lot of
politicians, she says one thing but then
votes another way on the issue of, &quot;Oh,
um um I didn&#39;t want to rat my my my
fellow my fellow Naval Academy
&gt;&gt; peers out.&quot; But then a week, two weeks
later, she says the opposite. Oh, I told
them everything.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, what&#39;s complicated about
that? I&#39;ll just say this having been
born a military brat. So, it&#39;s
frustrating to hear that someone who had
key information and an investigation for
cheating at an academy where our
military is being trained wouldn&#39;t come
forth with everything. So, it either
happened or it didn&#39;t. Some of those
records have leaked. I think that&#39;s
probably fact checkable. So, she should
stay consistent with her message. Um,
but I would say this, she says on day
one, she wants to freeze the cost of
utility. She says these things, but day
one, we talk about those issues. Day one
starts before you get in office. It&#39;s
like you&#39;ve got to have some policies at
this point um that supersede that. For
instance, I&#39;d like to jump to healthcare
because that&#39;s something that&#39;s at the
heart of the shutdown, the federal
government, and that&#39;s affecting every
state in in the republic right now, the
shutdown. Millions of people, 42 million
on SNAP about to feel a snap of food
assistance.
&gt;&gt; And by the way, I I probably if this
happens, we&#39;re all going to have to, you
know, step up and and go to our local
food banks and help people out.
&gt;&gt; So, let&#39;s do it. But we have that
spirit. So let&#39;s go do that. But my
question for you is healthare is one of
those things that as we get older and
you&#39;re still 29, you and Sean, but I&#39;ve
turned 30. And healthcare is one of
those things that you can&#39;t cut corners
with that. Like you you have to do it.
So what do you do to get the cost down
in New Jersey? What what&#39;s some some of
what your ideas?
&gt;&gt; I really believe that the job of any
governor, job number one, is public
health and safety. Uh, number one, we
got to make New Jersey a better place to
do business. So, more insurance
companies want to do business here. More
health insurance companies, more
competition. More competition, we drive
down prices. Uh, but we also have to
make sure that our independent docs and
pharmacists can not just survive, but
thrive here in the state. Provide some
competition to our health care systems.
And the healthare system CEOs agree with
that. So, there&#39;s a number of things
that we need to do, but government&#39;s got
to play its role. This is one of the
things that&#39;s not talked about enough in
New Jersey. Insurance rates across the
board have gone through the roof and
only added to the affordability crisis.
I&#39;ve read about you that you&#39;re ready to
partner um at least work across the
aisle with with Democrats. Tell me the
importance of that in this divided
environment.
&gt;&gt; Well, first let me say that back in 21
with the wind in my face, I flipped
eight seats in state legislature, the
most successful night in 34 years. With
the wind in my back this time around,
&gt;&gt; let me double down on with the wind in
my back this time around, I could flip
13 seats, and that gives us a Republican
majority for the first time in close to
three decades.
But well, let me this is a perfect
dubtail into a lot of Democrats are
coming out publicly for example Harris,
please stay. We love having you.
&gt;&gt; Uh I want to introduce uh to you now uh
three of Jack&#39;s supporters whose
endorsements have been critical and they
say a lot. Rabi Rabbi Morty Bernstein.
He is the Jackson, New Jersey Council
president. Represents the Ocean County
Jewish uh communities that endorse Jack.
That was a big endorsement. Uh I want to
talk to you in a second. Jeff Lewis,
also uh a Branchville Town Councilman
who is backing Jack. Welcome. Thank you.
You&#39;re a Democrat.
&gt;&gt; I forgive you. Um Jamal Holly, he is a
former Democrat New Jersey assemblyman.
He crossed the aisle to endorse. Rabbi,
let these are important endorsements.
You didn&#39;t have this the last time uh at
this level. It&#39;s all across the state.
What&#39;s what&#39;s different?
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s different is that everyone sees
Jack as a true friend, especially after
October 7th with the rising level of
anti-semitism throughout the state.
People see that Jack doesn&#39;t just care.
Jack thinks about the community. He he
responds to the community and he&#39;s there
no matter what and no matter where. So
that&#39;s really what changed. people see
him all over.
&gt;&gt; Jeff Lewis, let me ask you.
I
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sure you probably took some heat
being a Democrat and supporting Jack,
but you did it out of principle. Why?
&gt;&gt; I believe he&#39;s definitely the man for
the job. Um, as I was on Sandra&#39;s show
yesterday on Fox, thank you all. Um,
&gt;&gt; absolutely.
&gt;&gt; As I explained on there, um, actually
got a nasty phone call from a gentleman
after the show. Mikey hasn&#39;t shown me
anything. um her helicopter flying
children of mother of four children and
yes she&#39;s going to lower our electric
bills. That&#39;s her big
&gt;&gt; it really electric bills and Harris was
telling me backstage it is a big deal.
&gt;&gt; It is we we do and and look this is for
you to say more than me but we do have
nuclear in our in our state. We do have
some nuclear power. We have some of that
AI is coming on board. So we know that
there will be a thirst for more energy
through artificial intelligence. But
even without all of that, um, our
utilities are high. Can can you say why
that is and why it&#39;s so broken? And why
in the heck is our gas still $5 a gallon
in Edgewater, New Jersey,
but there are places in outstate and out
of state that are in the twos?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we talked about this at the top of
the hour. Uh, Phil Murphy shut down six
different electricity generation plants,
put a moratorium on natural gas fired
electricity generation, didn&#39;t expand
nuclear in South Jersey where three
reactors produce 40% of our electricity,
zero carbon emissions, and bet it all on
wind.
&gt;&gt; Bet it all on wind, and here we are
almost 8 years later.
&gt;&gt; So, what was a state that actually
exported electricity because we produce
more than we need, but we now have to
import through these exchanges. We pay
through the nose. I&#39;ll get it down on
day one by pulling out a Reggie. That
carbon tax policy has failed New Jersey
and drives up your monthly bill.
&gt;&gt; Let me go to Jamal. You you were a local
you were a state assemblyman.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Democrat.
&gt;&gt; I am still
&gt;&gt; welcome here. Glad you&#39;re here.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; A lot of times if you if you cross if if
you show any sense of reasonableness or
you want to get along with the other
side, oh that&#39;s like a that&#39;s like a
mortal sin.
&gt;&gt; I mean, but aren&#39;t we supposed to do
that? Yes.
&gt;&gt; Aren&#39;t we supposed to do that? I mean,
at what point is it
&gt;&gt; I think you just stand for what&#39;s right.
&gt;&gt; Seriously.
&gt;&gt; I mean, we are supposed to be working
together. And you know, one thing that
you and and Harris forgot about is that
this is going to be the long time uh in
the first time in a long time that we&#39;ve
elected a Jersey guy for once.
&gt;&gt; That matters.
&gt;&gt; That matters.
&gt;&gt; But I want to go in a little deeper.
&gt;&gt; That matters. That matters.
&gt;&gt; Eight years of Phil Murphy.
&gt;&gt; Eight years of Phil Murphy. So
democratic dominance for the most part
in the state for a long time
&gt;&gt; I was part of it.
&gt;&gt; You were part okay
&gt;&gt; I came across the aisle and that man
came across the aisle for me when I
entered the legislature in 2012 and he&#39;s
been a friend ever since.
&gt;&gt; You know this this ra by the way I love
your intellectual honesty and if you&#39;re
willing to have a conversation I try to
have John Federman&#39;s the only Democrat
really will come on my show. I&#39;m a nice
person right Harris.
&gt;&gt; Well look he&#39;s voting to reopen the
government. So, I mean, you you have to
start somewhere, right? He and Angus
King and and C and uh Cast Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; But but this is my question. I don&#39;t see
how we can reconcile those that want
defund, dismantle, no bail, and and
reimagine the police and send in the
social workers. I don&#39;t How do you
reconcile open borders, no vetting with
people that believe you need to come
into the country legally and get vetted
and do it the right way, then welcome to
our country? You know, how do you
reconcile Democrats in Washington that
voted for the largest tax increase in
history? They could have voted for the
largest tax decrease in history. How how
do we reconcile that?
&gt;&gt; And my opponent voted no on the big
beautiful bill which puts about $5,000 a
year back in the pocketbooks of
hardworking middle-ass New Jerseyians.
She voted no.
&gt;&gt; No tax on tips, overtime, social
security. She voted for the largest tax
increase in history. that doubles the
child care tax credit for families with
young kids and for those who want to
send their kids to private school.
Magnificent tax credit starting in 2027
from the big beautiful bill. If if your
governor opts in, I&#39;ve already said I&#39;m
in. My opponent is not.
&gt;&gt; She did vote for the in for the
inflation reduction act which did not
reduce in
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Mike Cheryl did. She did
vote for that and and that had a lot of
sweeteners in it for the green industry.
So, you were talking about those those
wind combines that are out in the middle
of the the ocean right now.
&gt;&gt; Not yet, and there won&#39;t be.
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re not going to let that happen.
&gt;&gt; Well, that&#39;s where that money was going.
&gt;&gt; All right. Why don&#39;t we come back? Can
you stay with us, Harris?
&gt;&gt; Are you kidding? I I want to talk to
these fine folks.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Come on.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; I will say this. I work with the nicest
people in the world and I I love
everybody in our Fox family. Thank you
for making Fox number one.
