from the conversation with the full
interview to be aired later on ITV Gold.
Welcome and I am Pand. You are watching
face to face right here on ITV Gold.
Tonight we are joined by Congresswoman
Mikey Cheryl, the Democratic nominee for
governor of New Jersey. Uh, Navy
helicopter pilot, former federal
prosecutor and now a US representative
Mikey Cheryl has built her career around
service and leadership. and she&#39;s
running for governor on a promise to
make New Jersey more affordable,
strengthen education, support small
businesses, and ensure every community,
including the vibrant South Asian
community, has a voice in shaping the
state&#39;s future. And Congresswoman
Cheryl, I would like to welcome you and
thank you for joining us.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, thank you so much for having
me. I really appreciate it. Okay, let&#39;s
start with, you know, you said your top
priority is making New Jersey more
affordable for working families. So,
what is the first major action you would
take as governor to deliver real relief?
&gt;&gt; Well, I&#39;m going to get to work right
away. So, on day one, I am declaring a
state of emergency on utility costs and
freezing rate hikes. I I really want
people uh across the state to know that
I have their back. That this is not
something I&#39;m going to focus on in 10 or
five years. I&#39;m doing it right away. I&#39;m
going to make sure that they are seeing
the support that they need to see from
government. So, I&#39;ll do that and then
I&#39;m going to go on to address cost in
health care and housing as well. So
taking on those landlords who are
colluding to drive up prices, taking on
PBMs or those middlemen um in
pharmaceutical sales who are driving up
costs for everyone sometimes up to 10
times and putting smallarmacies out of
business. So in those ways in housing,
healthcare, and utility costs, I&#39;m going
to get to work immediately driving down
costs for people.
&gt;&gt; All right. And you know, New Jersey&#39;s
economy thrives on small uh businesses
and many of them are run by immigrant
families including South Asians. So my
question to you is like how does your
plan specifically support small business
growth and innovation while keeping cost
manageable?
&gt;&gt; Well, as you know, um I&#39;m going to both
work to make it easier to own a small
business. And uh I&#39;ll have um a more
muscular business action center with a
dashboard so you can see where your
permitting is. You can have help with
the permitting process. Right now it&#39;s
very difficult to understand having a
fasttrack team who can help walk you
through the process, ensuring you can
get better access to small business
grants and loans. But at the same time
the tariffs we are seeing coming from
Washington have been devastating to so
many businesses about a 50% tariff on
goods from India and as we&#39;re coming up
on Dvali to see um as people go out to
try to buy the the food and the candles
and the dresses and all the stuff that
is only made in India to see these 50%
cost increases is really hard on
families. Uh the last time we saw each
other was around Oakree Road as as we
were talking to small businesses and the
Patel Brothers grocery store was saying
how it it was going to be a big hit to
them these tariffs and we were all very
worried because so many members of our
Indian-American community were telling
me that Patel brothers are just a staple
of life for them um for you know the the
food they go to to school with and their
lunchbox. They were showing me some of
the drinks that they had. Uh and then um
the the different um produce and stuff
that they work so hard to get. Well,
they are telling me that now they&#39;re
seeing the average cost of their goods
go up by 40 to 50%. We&#39;re all seeing
higher prices on groceries, but um
especially when it comes to produce
being imported um and all the tariffs
being put on it. So you know since
you&#39;re talking about tariffs which has
really made like ripple effects on
industries from manufacturing to retail.
So tell me what different is your
administration going to do about it?
So, like I said, here in New Jersey,
we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to make sure
that Trenton is doing everything it can
to help small business owners to drive
down the cost of opening up a small
business, cut through red tape and
permitting here in the state, drive down
cost of electricity, which is so
impactful on small businesses and their
ability uh to meet their uh their costs.
But I&#39;m also going to I&#39;m going to join
the tariff lawsuit on day one. Right
now, New Jersey is not a part of taking
this administration to court on these
tariffs. And really, I think many of
them are put in place illegally, and we
need to keep pushing to back this
administration off of those tariffs.
All right. So, you know, let&#39;s talk
about education and opportunity. You
have spoken about ensuring equal access
to quality education regardless of zip
code.
What key changes do you believe can make
New Jersey schools more equitable and
better prepare students for the jobs of
tomorrow?
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s something I think about all of
the time. I think a lot about our kids.
I have four kids, uh, three teenagers
and a 20-year-old. So, uh, our education
system here in New Jersey, I I can see
how important it is to our kids&#39; ability
to go on to get great opportunities to
get a good job. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m going
to make sure first of all that we&#39;re
addressing third grade reading. That is
a real inflection point for students. If
you can&#39;t read at grade level and third
grade, you&#39;re going to have a really
difficult time going on to further
studies. Um so we&#39;re going to teach uh
phonics education here. That&#39;s the best
way you can teach uh reading. We&#39;re
going to push in more uh highintensity
tutoring. That&#39;s evidence-based tutoring
that can help kids catch up. and we&#39;re
seeing across the state that children
have not caught up in the aftermath of
COVID. So, we really want to address
learning loss and third grade reading. I
also um want to push in some county
based school systems because some of our
county-based high schools are our best
performing schools. We can also create
great opportunities there in things like
occupational schools and STEM schools
and create nimble schools because as you
sort of alluded to
&gt;&gt; the workforce of the future and the jobs
of the future are going to be very very
different especially with AI and quantum
computing and um and making sure that
our students are ready for that is going
to be incredibly important.
&gt;&gt; All right. So now the question that
comes to my mind, you know, living in
the state of New Jersey, property taxes,
they remain one of the biggest burdens
for New Jersey homeowners. So what
specific reforms or partnerships would
you pursue to bring real sustainable
relief to families?
So we&#39;re see you property taxes have
gone up every single year and right now
as the cost of everything has gone up.
It&#39;s been particularly impactful on
people on a fixed income. So certainly
stabilizing property taxes for seniors
is something I&#39;m in favor of. Myo my
opponent opposes that. Um giving
property tax relief to seniors. I also
want to uh have shared services part of
this idea to do some of these
county-based high schools can also take
some of the financial burden off of
towns. Um we also need to share things
like municipal court systems and we have
to address the state health benefits
plan. That is the other way that um that
t property taxes have gone up
significantly because it&#39;s in a death
spiral. So, I&#39;m going to make sure that
we address that to drive cost down. But
my opponent, on the other hand, has
voted at every level of government he
serves to raise cost. He&#39;s voted against
a billion dollar of property tax relief
already. And he&#39;s supporting Trump in
$30 billion of hits on property tax
relief. So, he is definitely not focused
on, I think, addressing one of the key
costs that people face here, and that&#39;s
property taxes.
&gt;&gt; All right. So let&#39;s uh even talk about
energy and utility costs. You know you
have proposed declaring a state of
emergency to freeze utility rate hikes.
So how soon do you think you know
families will feel the impact of that
move you know once you are elected as
the governor?
&gt;&gt; Well the um rates are set to go up next
year. So I&#39;m going to freeze it so they
don&#39;t do that. at the same time drive in
a bunch of new power, solar, battery
storage, making our gas power generation
more efficient to generate more um and
then at the same time look on a
long-term path to nuclear because right
now we are in an energy market uh in the
region, the PJM region it&#39;s called. And
some of the states in this region have
very high power needs right now.
Virginia has really invest in huge data
centers. They&#39;re they&#39;re utilizing tons
of power. So, it&#39;s made all of our rates
go up. So, the energy we produce in
state can make all of our rates go down,
which is why I&#39;m so focused on it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So you know let&#39;s talk
about the New Jersey is you know has lot
of immigrant communities here and
including of course a large South Asian
population and I feel you know and I&#39;m
sure you also know that they face lot of
uh you know hate crimes and bias
incidents. So how will your
administration build like trust,
strength, safety and promote inclusion
statewide?
You know, that&#39;s something when I first
um got at into the US attorney&#39;s office,
I started work working with a lot of our
local communities because it&#39;s really
important that local communities know
they can trust our police officers and
law enforcement. But that takes a lot of
community building. It takes a lot of
outreach. It takes meetings so that
people are culturally competent and
aware of the different needs of the
community. So certainly as governor,
I&#39;ll make sure that we are working on
that so that people know they can trust
law enforcement. But other areas that
I&#39;m really focused on are things like
the kids online safety act. We are
seeing horrible hate going on online in
in just about every single community and
it&#39;s really creating horrible mental
health outcomes on our children. We need
age appropriate design code. I&#39;m going
to have a center of excellence to study
this because right now big tech has so
much access to information that we need.
I&#39;ll also push in more um effort into
schools and their mental health
resources to help our children navigate
this better. Um and help to stop the
increase in bullying that we&#39;ve seen
because the stories I hear from my
friends and what&#39;s happening to children
online is is really unacceptable and
creating I I think real fear among the
community. I mean, it of course doesn&#39;t
end in schools, which is why ensuring
that we have state resources to protect
houses of worship and communities,
community centers, etc. to make sure
they&#39;re more resilient because we&#39;re
also seeing a lot of political attacks
going on right now. And that is
something um that as governor I&#39;m going
to work very hard to keep everyone safe.
&gt;&gt; All right. And so my last question to
you of course is South Asian voter
engagement you know and the South Asian
community is one of the most active and
fastest growing voting blocks in New
Jersey. So tell me how important is this
community to your campaign and to the
kind of administration you plan to lead?
&gt;&gt; The South Asian community is incredibly
important and incredibly vibrant. Um
there are you know we have a lot of
elected officials here in New Jersey. uh
in fact the last time I was on um Indian
TV it was with Raj Mccuri and so we know
that they&#39;re they&#39;re such an influential
important group so many of the small
businesses a lot of the lifeblood of our
economy the South Asians are at the
heart of and the Indian-American
community is at the heart of um so it&#39;s
really important to me to ensure people
have a seat at the table that I am
reaching out to people throughout our
state throughout the South Asian
community to understand the needs needs
of the community so I can better drive
down costs, continue to help expand
businesses. Some of the stories that I
hear whenever whenever I&#39;m with the
South Asian community are really
heartwarming because they sort of um
emblem they&#39;re emblematic of the
American dream. I hear stories of people
coming here with three, four, five
dollars in their part pocket and getting
themselves through school and starting a
business that helps thousands. Um, so
making sure that we continue this
innovative culture here so that everyone
has access to opportunity is really
important to me.
&gt;&gt; You know, Congresswoman Cheryl, thank
you so much for joining us and sharing
your vision for New Jersey and we really
appreciate your time and wish you all
the best.
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you so much. I really
appreciate it.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
