So Jack, what do you want to say about
this? You know, she doubled down on it
again in a press conference. Here&#39;s what
she said later. Watch.
&gt;&gt; I think we&#39;ve laid out the case that
Jack is complicit with these opioid in
lead with these opioid companies. I
think he is right there with the people
that again paid billions of dollars. So
I think that the line is pretty clear.
Well, Jack, I guess we&#39;re in, let&#39;s see
what, you know, what sticks to the wall.
Uh, now attacking you for claiming all
of this. You&#39;re refuting it, obviously,
and you have given the green light to
your lawyers to file a defamation
lawsuit against her. Fox Business
reached out to Cheryl&#39;s camp for
comment. We still don&#39;t have it. What do
you want to say here, sir?
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s a reckless lie. I filed a
defamation suit. We&#39;re not letting her
get away with that lie. And we found out
in the last 48 hours that she took
campaign contributions from the very
companies that she&#39;s now condemning.
Listen, Maria, this is a person who&#39;s
based the entire campaign on a stack of
lies about me, including raising the
sales tax. I&#39;m not raising any taxes.
Her campaign is all about the disdain
for Donald Trump and that she can fly a
helicopter. None of that is going to fix
New Jersey. Uh but we&#39;re not going to
take this lie. And as I said, we&#39;re
filing our defamation suit. Well, you
make a lot of important points and
people want to know what the policies
are regarding taxes. I mean, if you look
at some of the other blue states, uh,
you add up the taxes I from federal to,
you know, to state to to local like New
York as well as New Jersey, you&#39;re
talking about a significant tax burden.
Are you going to cut taxes for citizens
of New Jersey?
&gt;&gt; Maria, we have to. I will reduce the
size and cost of our state government.
It took us 238 years to get to 36
billion state budget. In eight years,
we&#39;ve gone from 36 billion to 59
billion, a 64% increase. And nobody&#39;s
better off. It&#39;s bloated. It&#39;s
inefficient. It needs to be reduced in
size and cost. And when I do that, I can
afford a tax cut for businesses and
individuals. New Jerseyians faced the
highest overall tax burden in the
country. We&#39;re ranked as one of the
worst places in the country to do
business. It&#39;s why people are leaving.
The only way to grow the economy is to
make New Jersey a better place to do
business. I say we take somebody who&#39;s
got business experience, an MBA CPA,
who&#39;s put forth a very specific plan on
how to do that.
&gt;&gt; And of course, President Trump has
talked about uh you and and has
supported you. Tell me about the the
electorate and how they feel about
President Trump right now.
&gt;&gt; They&#39;re very grateful for what he&#39;s done
for New Jersey. He&#39;s put a temporary
halt on the wind farms off the Jersey
shore. Uh my opponent wants them there.
I don&#39;t. I&#39;ll make that permanent the
halt. Uh he&#39;s beaten up on the New York
Democrats over their congestion pricing
plan. That&#39;s an egregious money grab on
the backs of New Jerseyians. And let&#39;s
talk about what he did with the big
beautiful bill. You now can deduct up to
40,000 of your property taxes on your
federal tax return. It doubles the child
care tax credit for families with young
children. It doesn&#39;t tax tips overtime
and social security and provides a
magnificent tax credit for those who
send their kids to private school. If
your governor opts in, I will. My
opponent won&#39;t because she&#39;s owned by
the teachers union. All those things are
very good for New Jersey and the sense I
get is that New Jerseyians are grateful.
&gt;&gt; Well, look, we also are watching this
race in New York City and you&#39;ve got
speculation that uh Zoran Mani has taken
money from foreigners for his campaign.
Cheryl is facing her own heat for
reportedly taking donations from a
tycoon linked to the Chinese Communist
Party. Fox Digital writes this. Uh
Penny, the founder of Wang Zang America
Corporation, donated $60,000 to the One
Giant Leap Super PAC, which is backing
Mikey Cheryl&#39;s campaign in the form of
two checks in addition to giving her the
$5,800 individual Max donation directly
to Cheryl&#39;s campaign this summer,
according to records reviewed by Fox
News Digital and first reported by the
New York Post. Now, Fox Business has
also reached out to Cheryl&#39;s campaign on
this, and we are waiting for a response.
We have not gotten any answers to any of
this, but we talk about the Communist
Party of China all the time on this
program. What do you know about the
relation uh relationship between your
opponent and the CCP?
&gt;&gt; I know what you know because she won&#39;t
answer any questions about it. But this
is what happened in the debate last
week. It was news of this. It was news
of contributions from the opioid
manufacturers. It was her being punished
at the Naval Academy. It was her
breaking federal law on stock trades and
stock reporting. New York Times reports
that while sitting on the House Armed
Services Committee, she&#39;s trading
defense stocks. I really think what
happened last week, Maria, she cracked.
And when she cracked, she got very
reckless. And that reckless laid it led
to that blatant lie that I filed my
defamation suit about.
&gt;&gt; Well, political analysts are pointing
out the importance of this race and the
outcome ahead of the 2026 midterms. Fox
News contributor Liz Peak wrote about it
in this Fox News digital oped. She&#39;s
questioning will the Garden State voters
throw out the politicians who&#39;ve driven
people to leave the state for greener
pastures. Jack, your race is one of only
two governor races this year, the others
in Virginia. Tell us about the impact of
your race on 2026 and the midterms.
&gt;&gt; Maria, I get it. There&#39;s only two
governor races in the country this year,
as you said, and people talk about the
implications heading into the Trump
midterms of next year. There&#39;s only one
implication I&#39;m really worried about.
the implications for New Jersey if my
opponent were to win. She would be more
of the same, only worse. We cannot
afford another four years of Phil
Murphy&#39;s failed policies. We just can&#39;t.
So, I get it. I get the attention that
this race is getting all around the
country, but I&#39;m just focused on the
next 20 days doing everything I can to
deliver a win. I really do believe we&#39;re
going to win. I thought we were going to
win in 21. I knew it&#39;d be close, but
there&#39;s something very different this
time around. And again, the endorsements
of prominent Democrats says something.
&gt;&gt; Jack, you&#39;ve got to get the electorate
to come out. You&#39;ve got to get moderates
to come out and vote for you. What do
you want to tell the moderates this
morning to ensure that they&#39;re hearing
your platform?
&gt;&gt; Hey, if you want change, you have to
make a change. The Democrats have
controlled this legislature for 25
years. They&#39;ve controlled the executive
branch for the last eight years. We&#39;ve
got a property tax crisis. We&#39;ve got a
public education crisis. We have a
public safety crisis. We&#39;ve got an
overdevelopment crisis. in our suburban
communities. If you want change, you got
to make a change. Here&#39;s your chance.
&gt;&gt; All right, Jack. We&#39;ll be watching the
race certainly and we so appreciate your
leadership joining us this morning.
Thank you, sir.
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Maria.
&gt;&gt; Jack Chitterelli joining us in New
Jersey. We&#39;ll be right back.
