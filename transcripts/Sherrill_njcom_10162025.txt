Yeah, I don&#39;t even want to tell you what
my electric bill was this summer. It was
horrible. We um have a uh very old house
and um I love it. It&#39;s it&#39;s a great
house, but it is a house that I&#39;m
constantly working to make more energy
efficient. And um judging from the
electricity bills this summer have fa I
failed. Well, I&#39;m declaring a state of
emergency on day one and I&#39;m freezing
rate hikes. And I&#39;m doing that for
several reasons. Number one, because I
am furious that as I trace back what&#39;s
going on in the utility markets. This
has been something that was foreseen and
yet too many different organizations
kick the can down the road and then
suddenly put it all in the backs of the
New Jersey ratepayers. So, I&#39;m really
angry about that that that sort of
mismanagement of our utilities um led to
the ratepayer paying for it and
especially people who as I charted out
just can&#39;t afford it right now. We have
some money that comes in through BPU
from Reggie and others that we can use
to defray some of this. But in speaking
to a lot of the people that work in this
industry too, I think it&#39;s made people
take like I I think it&#39;s made people
sort of shake off the cobwebs to say,
&quot;Oh yeah, we have a crisis and we can&#39;t
kick the can down the road and we can&#39;t
pretend it&#39;s not happening and we can&#39;t
just hope it goes away. We all need to
come to the table and deal with this.&quot;
So housing costs have gone up
tremendously. But you&#39;ve also pointed
something else out. We have um some of
the most environmentally fragile places
in our state because of climate change.
The shore itself is um some of the most
at risk from rising sea levels in the
world. Um I&#39;ll also tell you and we have
tons of river flooding. I&#39;ve seen it in
the Rawe, the Whippony, the Pacman, the
Pake. Um, so we have all kinds of
challenges, which is why we need to
protect some of the wetlands and open
spaces for community enjoyment, but we
also need to build out housing
infrastructure and so um, we need to
have a statewide plan to do that and and
that I think has been really lacking
largely because of local control. So
coming up with a statewide plan when you
have five, you know, all all the
municipalities weighing in, I I think
has made it this environment where
everybody is constantly litigating over
it because there&#39;s no vision. And so
it&#39;s a fight and what happens in too
many cases is some mayor of some town
will be really clever and they don&#39;t
want some project. So, they zone it
industrial
and then five mayors later, some
developer comes in and says, &quot;We&#39;re
going to build a warehouse on this
soccer field.&quot; And the mayor&#39;s like,
&quot;No, you won&#39;t.&quot; And then they&#39;re like,
&quot;It&#39;s zoned industrial. You know, you
guys did this.&quot; So, I think a a broader
vision. Um, and that&#39;s going to involve
zoning help from the state. It&#39;s going
to involve um not only developing and
transit oriented development,
repurposing some of this commercial
development and building out on already
built upon state so we can preserve open
spaces. Um but also looking at some
areas of the state which historically
had been more dense like Trenton and
Atlantic City which I think really could
be thriving cities with some support
from the state. And then at the same
time looking at where we&#39;re going to
build new neighborhoods as we think
about the economy of South Jersey and
how we&#39;re going to invest there and what
transportation across the state&#39;s going
to look like. And this is a statewide
plan. This is okay. Here&#39;s a new transit
hub that we&#39;re going to build out. A new
neighborhood&#39;s going to be here. And
it&#39;s, you know, going to be job
opportunities to get here, here, and
here. And this area is going to be um
more open space, wetlands, um flooding
prevention, etc. And we&#39;re going to have
to we&#39;re going to have to get buy in. Um
and I was just asked recently about the
Glboro Camden line. And right now we
have tons of opportunity. We have a lot
of people who really want it. I mean,
you know, connecting Rowan and Camden
and the Eds and Meds corridor could be
great for the economy, but then we have
these groups that are really against it.
And so, as governor, I&#39;m going to bring
everybody together and say, &quot;What is the
problem here? What are you worried
about? And here&#39;s the vision here and
what it would look like and here&#39;s what
we&#39;re committed to. And then let&#39;s get
buy in from the area or an agreement
that, you know, we&#39;re going to we&#39;re
going to push in here, here, and here,
and this is the way we&#39;re going to do
it. We love this. We love this
development. Here&#39;s why this development
could harm wetlands. Let&#39;s But this kind
of constant, we just fight and fight and
fight and then somebody forces it and
something happens. But it doesn&#39;t feel
thoughtful and it doesn&#39;t feel and I
doesn&#39;t just not feel like it. I can
tell you 1,000% we&#39;re not getting the
housing developed that we need.
So, um, we, you know, as I&#39;ve said in
numerous occasions, uh, we have more
municipalities than California and we
have more school districts than
municipalities. And we have school
districts where they&#39;re just not even
running a K through 12 program. So we
really need to address the
administrative fees because that&#39;s a key
area where if you ask any parent, any
family in this state, where do they want
their money to go for schools? It&#39;s
kids, right, and education, it&#39;s
teachers, it&#39;s some of the old school
buildings and infrastructure that we
need. It&#39;s not this bloated
administrative system. So, we really do
need to um share services, consolidate
some of these administrative systems.
I&#39;d also um I&#39;m also going to address
the state health benefits plan that so
between schools and the state health
benefits plan. That&#39;s where a lot of the
costs are coming from for property
taxes. And so, um we&#39;ve seen the state
health benefits plan go up by 20 30% a
year. So, um, immediately getting an
independent auditor in there to claw
back some of the funding for the state,
which is nobody knows, nobody&#39;s taking a
look under the hood. That should save
millions. But also then having more
competition in the market, looking at
the rules and regulations for Horizon,
which sort of make it non-competitive in
certain ways and and really making sure
we&#39;re driving down costs and fixing the
state health benefits plan. And then we
also have um the municipal courts where
we could share services there. I think
that would be a key place too to see
costs go down. Um, and that is all the
property tax. And I think that&#39;s really
different from my opponent who again and
again just does not seem to be concerned
with driving down taxes. He&#39;s voted to
raise them at every level of government
he&#39;s been in. Um, he&#39;s been supportive
of Trump re-implementing the state and
local tax deduction cap, which uh takes
off the table about $30 billion in
property tax relief. And he&#39;s even said
stuff like, you know, I think people are
willing to pay a little more taxes in
their town. So, um, I&#39;m going to drive
those down.
Well, I I think in energy, for example,
in fact, uh, Murphy himself has has been
on the other side of what I say I&#39;m
going to do. You know, I have built out
this plan and it&#39;s not where he&#39;s gone.
Um, I also think I have a very different
background and come from a different
place. So that this idea of having a
culture shift in Trenton, having public
servants who actually serve the public
and cutting through the red tape and
demanding that our public serve the
public and and having the vision so
everyone in government&#39;s working
together and we don&#39;t have these kind of
siloed cabinets um DCA, DOT, D working,
you know, kind of in their own a lot of
projects
go through all of these places and we
need to all be marching to the beat of
the same drum. So that that&#39;s different.
And I think what people are seeing
because, you know, that kind of gets to
the difficulty of running in the same
political party as a two-term governor.
And that&#39;s often been almost impossible
here. But I think the difference here is
people see, you know, Jack Chidarelli is
a perennial candidate. He&#39;s running for
the third time. He&#39;s brought no new
ideas. And now his latest stickick is
he&#39;s just going to do whatever Trump
says. And so uh that I think has become
more apparent each day. And now this
gateway tunnel thing I think everybody&#39;s
like even now you can&#39;t even come up.
You can&#39;t even be your own man here. Um
I think is having the effect of people
seeing that he&#39;s actually the status quo
candidate who won&#39;t bring change to the
state. Whereas I think I&#39;ve laid out a
pretty strong platform of exactly how I
am going to create change.
So, I am going to um we are going to see
third grade reading scores go up in my
administration. Um that is just a key
inflection point. And so, we see um if
you can&#39;t read at grade level in the
third grade, you&#39;re going to have a
really hard time then being successful
in your academic career. meaning in
fourth grade you&#39;re going to have
trouble reading your math and social
studies and history assignments and you
know as you go up science and health I
mean it&#39;s just it it sort of snowballs
from there which is why so many
educators see that as kind of this key
inflection point we know what works uh
phonics space reading education which
has that&#39;s actually how I learned to
read but I&#39;ll tell you I have four kids
and that&#39;s not what they were given to
read and um uh for various reasons I had
to help some of them learn to it was
very very difficult. So uh so getting
back to phonics based reading I know the
state has some funding and and I want to
make sure we have that so teachers can
get that kind of training as we move
into phonics based reading education.
Um, also highintensity tutoring. So if a
student needs extra support, that&#39;s a
very particular evidence-based kind of
tutoring that&#39;s tied to the school,
that&#39;s a half an hour, three times a
week, that&#39;s based on the school
curriculum, same tutor each time. That
kind of tutoring has shown really good
results in getting kids back on track as
well.
I certainly uh would require um the MMR
vaccines. uh you know
if you look at the numbers of children
dying from things like measles and mumps
and rebel if you look at polio
and to think that we had all but
eradicated these diseases and now we&#39;re
walking that back I just it&#39;s it&#39;s been
50 years we&#39;ve been giving these
vaccines and because of that hundreds of
thousands of kids lives have been saved
and it&#39;s not just the kids. It&#39;s when
you go into schools and you&#39;re exposed
to this and right now we are, you know,
we are seeing across the country
movement away from her immunity. I think
some of these diseases, it&#39;s about 95.
We&#39;re down at 93. I think we&#39;ve already
had 10 measles cases here in New Jersey.
We&#39;re the most densely populated state
in the nation. Imagine your mom or dad
visiting you, your sen, you know, if
they&#39;re seniors like mine are, and your
kid comes home from school and gives
them measles, mubella. I mean, imagine
if um you have a baby who&#39;s too little
to be vaccinated. I had four kids. So, a
lot of times I had kids in school and I
had newborn a newborn at home. Um, and
you know, you you know, the baby dies
because as we&#39;re seeing, I mean, we&#39;re
seeing babies die across the country
from whooping cough, pertasus. It&#39;s I
mean, to think that we had all but
eradicated this and we&#39;re going to walk
that back based on
RFK Jr. who seems to get a lot of his
medical information from influencers on
TikTok. I I just it&#39;s mindboggling to
me. And so, uh yeah, we are going to
make sure that kids are appropriately
vaccinated to go to school.
