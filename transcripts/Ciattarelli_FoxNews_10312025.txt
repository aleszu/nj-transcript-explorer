&gt;&gt; After your championship teams finish
strong and they win championships, you
all are on the team. What are you going
to do over the next four days besides
vote? Anybody you run into, don&#39;t ever
underestimate the power of the personal
testimonial. I don&#39;t care if it&#39;s in

&gt;&gt; Do we need a change?

to make a change. Here&#39;s our chance,
guys. Especially strong.

the direction of New Jersey. Let&#39;s get
this done. Come on. Let&#39;s get this
going.
&gt;&gt; All right, guys. Thank you for coming
out. Let&#39;s go.
