Speaker B: Now.
Speaker A: The next governor is great state.
Speaker B: I've never been more committed, never been more determined because of you. Never been more energized and never been more confident. We're winning this election. Now we've got 21 counties in the state. Every county plays a role in a statewide election. But know this. Something I've long known and won't say about Bergen County. Bergen county has a greater population than eight states and a road to statewide victory goes to word county. It is the fifth one of the top five counties, one of the top five towns in terms of population. This town matters. And I want to say something about as I go about law matters. Yes, we depend on our president for national security, national economy, international affairs. Yes, we depend on our governor for responses to natural disasters and public education infrastructure. But make no mistake, your daily quality of life in your town is dependent on the job your mayor does. And this guy doesn't damage.
Speaker A: It.
Speaker B: Is humbled and honored to have his endorsement. Now, last weekend I got endorsed by the mayor of Google. That's right in the middle of the congressional district to my opponent. He's a Democrat and now another Democrat has endorsed my candidacy. But this mayor's going a step further today. He's changing his party affiliation to Republican. So your next lieutenant governor James Dan the sheriff Morris county and I want to welcome your mayor to the right side of the aisle. I know one of things that excited your mayor so much is my choice for lieutenant governor. A 40 year decorated local law enforcement officer working to support the working men and women in blue. Now the press is going to ask you what do you think is it didn't let the mayor to convert to Republicans. Did the democrats think he made a choice? For the past seven and a half years every single policy has been a failure under the current administration. Policies that are supported by my opponent when I was housing. Look what's happening with the overdevelopment of our communities with regard to property taxes because of a flawed school funding formula with regard to public safety because they don't support law enforcement; with regard to the public education curriculum where we slip 2 to 12 on national report card. These are the failures of the current administration and that all changes on day one of our administration we take power. This is quite an easy decision for mayor but make no mistake changing parties is a very courageous decision. And we applaud you mayor for your courageousness. And I know what every assurance me and the next lieutenant governor on what it is that happens on day one of this administration. Executive order number one on day one no time to see if we sanction city we get an attorney general appointed by me that supports both our police and our parents when it comes to policing. That means getting rid of cashes bail. We got a special pupil to run that. Talk to your local cops about arrest release repeat. It's real. It's the warlock There's Dr. Be a consequence of breaking the law and there will be under my administration. Sen. Attorney general will also support me in getting rid of policy 5756 in our schools. The notion of school district keeping secrets from parents is immoral is day one. On day one of my administration will go before the supreme court and make a case for stopping all this over development in our suburban community. We'll make a case for new school funding so communities like this don't get their fair share of state funding for our school. And I really want our call for the resignation of all those that sit on the state board of education that have made all those offensive changes to our public school curriculum. We're getting back to basis they want to respect parents. This is what this election is all about. And I'll tell you what as I go around this state it's not just Republicans who are crying out for change. It's unappealling independent voters and, yes, even moderate Democrats who have come to the realization that this current administration has failed in New Jersey. Make no mistake, we cannot afford another four years of Phil Burton's Phil policy. Now, what I see the Democrats doing is something they've done before that has failed. John Coles and I came here from Illinois. That didn't work out so well. Phil Murphy came here from Massachusetts. That hasn't worked out so well. My opponent's not from New Jersey. So I got a really neat idea. How about we elect the Jersey guy? How about we elect the Jersey? I've been here my entire life. This is home. Always has been, always will. And you don't need to worry about me, get distracted, because I don't want to be Congressman. I don't want to be U.S. senator. I don't want to be president. I don't want to write a book. I just want to fix a state we all love. And you can't be fixed. So here's what we're going to do. Over the course of the next 62 days, Jim Gann and I, with the help your mayor and a whole lot of people in this room, are going to continue to go all around this state, 564 towns, 21 counties, north central South Virginia shore, and yes, all 600 diners. I've been to every one of them. Put them out there. We are going to carry our message up and down this state of how we go. Ralph Rickson, New Jersey. Now, fasten your seatbelt, because here's what my opponent's going to do for the next 62 days. If you get a flat tire on the way home tonight, she's going to blame it on President Trump. She's going to tell you in the next few days that she's a woman. The mayor is asking her to remind you that I'm a man. She's going to tell everybody she's a mother of four. I'll tell you I'm a father of four. She's going to tell you she's an attorney. Tell you I'm a cpa. She's going to tell you she knows how to run a helicopter. I'm going to tell you she doesn't know a damn thing about running. The state of New Jersey knows what the hell is going on. The Chedis have been here for 100 years. Three generations of Chedis have achieved their American dream right here in New Jersey. My grandfather worked his Way up out of the ditch. Became a very successful independent contractor. My parents were very successful restaurant bar. I could not have asked for two better parents. They were people of integrity, people with great work ethic. And they reminded my three siblings and me every single day of our responsibilities to each other, to our family, to our community, our state, our country. Told us never expect anything other return than America promise of opportunity. It was also in that house that my parents reminded my three siblings and I that in that house we had no rights. We got one right, age 18, the right to leave. My mother used a wooden spoon. I was working at Jersey Shore last week and I saw a guy, I had a T shirt, he said I survived a wooden spoon. I went and got that boat man. I went and got that door. I followed in my grandparents and parents footsteps and I'm a two time business owner here in the state. But along the way I've had the privilege of serving two general levels of council president in some county prior to integrator, two terms of sums of general, what we used to call the free opens. 32 year terms of the general assembly terming myself each and every time I know what's going on here in the state of Jersey, I'm not afraid to make the bold decisions to turn things around and even depend on me. I will not lose my focus. Each and every day we're going to roll up our sleeves and we're going to fix this damn for me. Young I asking you for the privilege to serve as your younger. But make no mistake, whether it's four or eight years, I'll give you all that I've got. When it's all over, I'm going to the Peach and Surf City. This is home. Always has been, always worthy. And I want to thank you all for being here today. Mayor, thank you for the endorsement, thank you for the great switch to Republican. It reminds me of something Ronald Reagan once said. I didn't leave the Democratic Party. It left me. And so together with your help, we'll get it done. 60, 62 days, all gas, no break. Let's get time. Let's get it done. You know what you think this campaign is?
Speaker A: It's.
