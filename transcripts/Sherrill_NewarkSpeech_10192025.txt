over to my friend, my future colleague
and your next governor, Mikey Cheryl.
Wow.
&gt;&gt; So, some of you have heard this before,
but Wes Moore is my dad&#39;s favorite
governor,
and I am not convinced that when I win
on November 4th that that is going to
change.
So here here&#39;s hoping. Here&#39;s hoping.
But it is wonderful to be here today.
And I&#39;ll tell you, you guys have been
fired up. You&#39;ve heard why this is
important. But I&#39;m just going to I&#39;m
going to kind of bottom line it right
now as your closing speaker.
&gt;&gt; So if you aren&#39;t fired up and ready to
go, then then you haven&#39;t been
listening. So I&#39;m just going to I&#39;m just
going to trace out why we have to do
this.
I&#39;m going to start with tariffs.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m going to start with tariffs. Have
any of you heard about the tariffs?
&gt;&gt; Right. Have you noticed that everything
from the cup of coffee that you drink in
the morning to the groceries you buy to
make dinner at night have gone up every
single day. Has anybody noticed that?
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s ridiculous.
It&#39;s ridiculous. You know what I call
this tariff plan? I call it a worldwide
extortion racket
&gt;&gt; because as we pay more, the president is
pocketing billions of dollars.
&gt;&gt; There you go.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So on day one, I am going to join the
lawsuit against these tariffs that
states have engaged in. Do you want to
know what Jack Chidarelli said?
He said we should all take on a little
bit of pain to support
&gt;&gt; the president.
&gt;&gt; No,
&gt;&gt; I want to talk about something else
here. Has anybody heard, and I think
it&#39;s really misnamed, but has anybody
heard about the one big beautiful bill?
&gt;&gt; Taking away health care from kids.
&gt;&gt; Taking away healthare. Taking away food
support
&gt;&gt; from children who are hungry. Uh-uh.
&gt;&gt; Seniors,
&gt;&gt; students with disabilities, adults with
disabilities,
&gt;&gt; not even funding innovation and medicine
so we can create new jobs in the future.
&gt;&gt; And guess what Jack said when he was
asked about it?
&gt;&gt; You know what he said? He gave the
president an a.
[Music]
Well,
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll all be surprised to
hear that I gave the president an F.
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know if any of you have to go
into the city or commute by bus or take
public transportation, but the biggest
program of national significance in the
entire nation is the Gateway Tunnel.
Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And over 200,000 New Jerseyians take
that every day to get to work.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And the president of the United States
said he was going to terminate it.
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s almost a 100,000 jobs. And if we
don&#39;t have that federal money, all the
bus lines we want to open up, the
microtransit that we&#39;re funding, that
all becomes hard to do because we have a
huge hole in our budget,
&gt;&gt; that could cost us a million dollars a
day when that funding dries up.
&gt;&gt; And what did Jack Chidarelli say?
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re going to love this one. He said,
&quot;That&#39;s not a New Jersey problem.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Whose problem is it?
&gt;&gt; Man, that guy&#39;s out of touch.
And so let&#39;s take it down a notch. Let&#39;s
make it a little more granular here
because we know what the fight is. As we
see this president attacking vulnerable
communities, running one of the most
racist governments we&#39;ve seen in our
lifetimes. As we saw those young
Republicans and those disgusting
remarks.
&gt;&gt; Is anybody surprised?
&gt;&gt; I think we knew.
&gt;&gt; I think we knew. So, as we see all of
that,
&gt;&gt; we here are fighting hard for all of our
communities and when Jack Chidarelli was
asked, &quot;Do black communities have a seat
at the table? Do Latino communities have
a seat at the table?&quot; Does anybody
remember what he said?
&gt;&gt; Next question.
&gt;&gt; Next question,
&gt;&gt; man.
So, we know we know what the fight&#39;s
about.
&gt;&gt; We know that the future of all of our
kids matters.
&gt;&gt; We know who we support.
&gt;&gt; And we heard a little bit about some of
the ways in which we lift people up here
in this state. We heard about how
important the minimum wage is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; we heard about that.
&gt;&gt; Jack Shinerelli
didn&#39;t vote against the minimum wage one
time. That&#39;s right.
&gt;&gt; Two times he didn&#39;t vote against it
three times. He didn&#39;t vote against it
four times. He&#39;s voted against it five
times.
[Music]
&gt;&gt; So, I just wanted to lay it out for
everyone here, but it sounds like
everybody here kind of knows it,
&gt;&gt; which I&#39;m really glad to hear.
So, that&#39;s important because you guys
are the guys that I&#39;m counting on to get
the message out to everybody else. So
getting on the doors, fighting for the
things we care about. And here&#39;s the
thing that we know and this is why your
work is so important and why I
appreciate you because what we know is
that New Jersey is not a red state.
&gt;&gt; No, we&#39;re blue.
&gt;&gt; And I am sorry 32 BJ, I love you so
much, but New Jersey is not a purple
state.
&gt;&gt; No, no, no. New Jersey
&gt;&gt; is a blue state.
&gt;&gt; And so all we have to do is get
everybody to the polls
&gt;&gt; because when we vote,
&gt;&gt; we win.
&gt;&gt; When we vote,
&gt;&gt; we win.
&gt;&gt; When we vote,
&gt;&gt; we win.
&gt;&gt; So let&#39;s get everybody to vote. Thank
you. Thank you, guys.
[Applause]
