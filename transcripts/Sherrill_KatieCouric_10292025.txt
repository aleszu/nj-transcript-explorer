federal prosecutor. She&#39;s a mom of four,
and she&#39;s been a ve in a very
contentious race against Republican Jack
Chitterelli. Um, and this is one of
those, uh, campaigns that&#39;s getting a
lot of national attention. So, uh, I she
said I can call her Mikey. Congresswoman
Cheryl, aka Mikey, thanks so much for
doing this. I really appreciate it.
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you. Thanks so much.
&gt;&gt; Have you done a Substack yet? I think I
have, but it&#39;s been a minute. So, it was
good to kind of go over some of it
beforehand. That was
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, well, welcome. I&#39;m really uh
really thrilled to have this
conversation. You have such an
impressive CV, by the way. You&#39;re from
Virginia originally. Where did you grow
up?
&gt;&gt; Mostly Rristen, Virginia.
&gt;&gt; Oh, cuz I&#39;m from Arlington.
&gt;&gt; I thought you were from Northern
Virginia. Okay. How
&gt;&gt; did you go to high school?
&gt;&gt; South Lakes High School. I graduated
with Grant Hill. That&#39;s kind of my claim
to fame.
&gt;&gt; Well, you&#39;re a lot younger than I am.
And I uh I all I know is who did Oh,
Eric Schmidt went to my high school who
started Google.
&gt;&gt; Uh Emily Kurrick, my Emily Kurrick, my
sister who um
&gt;&gt; Oh, I got it. Well, Megan and Mary
Cheryl then. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; Give me something for not starting
there.
&gt;&gt; But my sister was um you know was
running for lieutenant governor. I don&#39;t
know if you know this with with um
&gt;&gt; God, what is wrong with me? Uh with Mark
Warner and then she was diagnosed sadly
with pancreatic cancer, had to drop out
of the race and and sadly tragically
passed away. But she was replaced by Tim
Kaine. And the only reason I mention
this is everyone thought that my sister
Emily was going to be the first one day
be the first female governor of
Virginia. And now in Abigail Spamberger,
uh, it looks like we could possibly get
our first female governor. And I know
that you two were roommates on Capitol
Hill when you were both in Congress. How
weird is it that you&#39;re both running for
governor, governor of your respective
states?
&gt;&gt; It is bizarre, isn&#39;t it? Um, she was
born in New Jersey. I was born in
Virginia. She&#39;s running in Virginia. I&#39;m
running in New Jersey. She&#39;s the oldest
of three girls. I&#39;m the oldest of three
girls. It&#39;s Yeah, we were roommates in
Congress. It&#39;s It&#39;s one of those weird
things. Um like uh Adams and Jefferson
dying on the same day and you know,
you&#39;re just kind of like the universe is
a little odd sometimes.
&gt;&gt; That is odd. It&#39;s like that Kennedy
Lincoln thing uh that we used to look at
when we were we were kids. So, you know,
I I&#39;m curious. I interviewed uh Abigail
Spanberger. I guess it was last week uh
or maybe the week before. I can&#39;t really
remember. But um you both obviously
served in Congress and and I&#39;m curious
why you decided you wanted to run for
governor and some of the things that you
believe you&#39;ll be able to do as governor
that you couldn&#39;t do as a member of
Congress.
&gt;&gt; Well, we see that the president has just
co-opted so much of the power in
Washington uh through the presidency.
And I I would say definitely it&#39;s a
problem that uh Republicans have the
majority in the Senate and the House,
but the House and Senate leadership has
have also just given so much power to
the presidency. He&#39;s uh co-opted the
courts pretty effectively. So there&#39;s
really a need for governors to stand in
the breach here and to expand state
power. And you see it in so many
different ways. as you see it in the
Northeast Coalition of States working to
get vaccines in the wake of RFK or to
give good medical advice with RFK Jr.
putting out um
you know some very odd stuff that I I
think sometimes he gets from influencers
on TikTok. So at that point, you need
governors to stand in the breach, but
it&#39;s also in pushing back against things
like National Guard on the streets or
climbing back federal money to start to
run health programs because uh the
president&#39;s now taken away um things
like, you know, federally qualified
health care centers and and money for
those and then the SNAP funding. So
again and again you see this attack on
how we create opportunity, how we run an
economy, how we um have children get
access to a great education and it&#39;s
really governors that have the ability
to make change here and almost no one
else at this time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let&#39;s talk about some of your
positions and and why you think you are
pro the best candidate to lead the
state. You know, if someone if a Martian
landed here and said, you know, Mikey
Cheryl, what do you stand for? What
would you tell that Martian? That&#39;s a
very weird question. I realize
that yeah, that does make a good
question. What would I tell a Martian?
Um, but if the Martian was specifically
asking me about running New Jersey, um,
I would say, uh, largely I am focused on
continuing the path that I I think the
United States has been on for almost 250
years of opening up opportunity to
people. Meaning that we all know people
haven&#39;t had a seat at the table. But I
look at the background of my family. It
was my grandpa&#39;s union job after they
lost everything in the Great Depression
that helped put my mom&#39;s side of the
family squarely in the middle class. Or
my dad being able to work and put
himself through college and then not be
he wasn&#39;t in debt for 30 years, right?
He just worked his way through college,
got a good job, and that helped my
family um be securely in the middle
class. Even in my own lifetime,
uh when I wanted to go to the Naval
Academy and to be a pilot like my
grandfather, um I remember my dad saying
I was in about the fifth grade and he
said, you know, well, Mike, I don&#39;t even
I don&#39;t know if the Naval Academy even
takes women or if the Navy has women
pilots, but by the time I graduated, I
graduated with the first class of women
eligible for combat on ships and
aircraft. And that completely changed
the trajectory
probably of my life and my opportunity.
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any accident that it
was myself and Elaine Lura who were the
first Naval Academy graduate women to
serve in Congress because before they
changed those those rules, you were just
on you were a secondass citizen in the
military. And so there are all these
ways in which we&#39;ve opened up
opportunity pe for so many people. And
it feels now as in as as if we&#39;re in
this time of of compression of rights of
taking away reproductive rights and um
economic rights and the ability to u
compete in so many spaces.
And so I really want to make sure New
Jersey continues to open up opportunity
to everyone and has that ability. We
have one of the most diverse states in
the nation. We&#39;re one of the most
innovative states in the nation. We have
more engineers and scientists per square
mile than anywhere else. So the attacks
that Trump is doing are so out of line
with what we want to do in New Jersey.
And then my opponent has oddly just
really tied himself 100% to trust to
Trump. just won&#39;t even call him out on
defunding the Gateway Tunnel, which is
this huge infrastructure project, the
biggest in the nation, that Trump has
said he&#39;s going to terminate. And oddly,
uh, my opponent said that&#39;s not a New
Jersey problem. So, he just he won&#39;t
stand up to the president on anything.
Let&#39;s I I&#39;m curious as someone who went
to the Naval Academy who was a Navy
pilot, how you felt about that gathering
uh in Quantico, Virginia of military
leaders from all around the world
basically getting uh lectured by the
Secretary of War, uh Pete Hegsath. Uh I
I I wonder how you felt when you were
watching that. You know, we have our
military members have such a difficult
choice.
At what point are you serving your
country in one of the most powerful
organizations in the United States and
trying to keep this train from careening
off the tracks and trying to keep
Hegsth, the most incompetent Secretary
of Defense we&#39;ve ever had, who&#39;s an
alcoholic, has credible claims of sexual
assault against him, has run every
organization he&#39;s been in charge of into
the ground. How do you like, you know,
how can you stay at your job and try to
keep the train from running off the
tracks or at what point do you become
complicit? And you just saw with the
admiral who quit in the wake of the um
bombings of of some of the ships off of
South America, saying, you know, he he
couldn&#39;t no longer serve if that was the
job. But it&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s this it&#39;s
this really difficult choice. I hear
from people uh in the military. I hear
it from people at US attorney&#39;s offices
across the country who are just trying
to figure out
how do I fulfill my oath to serve this
country and at what point like I said,
you know, do you just find that you&#39;re
complicit? It&#39;s really difficult. And I
I kept thinking of that as I was
watching this. And then um you know,
it&#39;s been heartbreaking really to watch
some of this because what&#39;s so awful
about what&#39;s going on now in our
military is is we had come so far. So um
we had a superintendent who was a woman.
We had a chief of naval operations, the
highest ranking person in the Navy who
was a woman. We had the first CEO of an
aircraft carrier. Uh a good portion of
our midshipman were women. It just it
felt so different. It felt like
everything, you know, all the kind of
knocks that I I took and people of my
era took as women in the military were
worth it because we&#39;d built something
better. And now to see some of that
being taken apart is hard to watch.
&gt;&gt; Well, I&#39;ll I&#39;ll I&#39;ll bite Mikey. At what
point do they become complicit? I mean,
when they talk to you about that,
whether they&#39;re,
you know, lawyers and in US attorneys
offices or if they&#39;re members of the
military, uh they obviously are
wrestling with this. Uh what are you
hearing from those folks in terms of
like whether they stay or whether they
go and what they or whether they speak
out?
Yeah, it&#39;s a really difficult choice and
some people feel they don&#39;t have much of
a choice if they have a family um to
feed and if they have, you know, a year
out. But I I know one gentleman who had
18 years. So 20 years is a retirement
with all the benefits. He had 18 years
in and he quit because he just he felt
like he had you know was about to cross
the line. And I think sometimes it
depends on what your job is and
sometimes it depend you know sometimes
it&#39;s picking your moment if you feel as
if okay something is coming and you know
it would be more powerful to for me to
speak out at the right time but I
struggle because um you know I have
family members in the military and I&#39;m
just not sure I struggle with should I
start to advocate for them to get out
should I start to say you guys got to go
you know before you find yourselves
you know on the streets of Chicago
um or do we need them there to try to
dissuade others at this point? And so I
think sometimes it&#39;s um it&#39;s a matter of
the role you&#39;re in and the you know if
you find yourself closer and closer to
that choice but it&#39;s really tough too
because in the military you can&#39;t just
quit. You know what I&#39;m saying? You you
you can&#39;t all of a sudden just for many
people it&#39;s it&#39;s very hard to resign.
You might have a a service contract that
you have to fulfill. So, it&#39;s really
it&#39;s really tough and I I struggle with
how I feel about it all the time as well
and what the right time would be.
&gt;&gt; I I&#39;m curious, you know, you say that
your opponent Jack Chidurelli is really
uh you know, hitching his wagon to
Donald Trump star, holding on to his
code, however you want to describe it.
Um, how much of this campaign for you
has been has involved talking about
Donald Trump versus your vision for New
Jerseyians? Because I think one of the
criticisms, as you well know, the
Democratic Party is people know what
they are against, but they don&#39;t really
know what they stand for anymore, and
it&#39;s not a very unified vision for the
country. So, I&#39;m curious how you&#39;ve been
able to balance those two things.
So, two things. Um, you you know, I&#39;ve
always run really hard races. Um, in
fact, the first race I ran in 2018,
Michael Moore had um done a documentary
on running a ficus tree against my
opponent in that race because he said um
he was so entrenched that it wouldn&#39;t
matter if you ran a fist tree or
Democrat against him that nobody was
going to notice. He was just going to
win again and again. So um feeling um
that I could do better than a fus tree,
I entered the race and we were able to
have the largest red to blue swing in
the entire nation because we we started
I started by listening to everyone by
just you know finding out what is that
thing that&#39;s keeping you up at night and
and what can I do as a member of
Congress or now as your governor to
address that. And I&#39;ll tell you
affordability. And I know you know it&#39;s
some sometimes when the answer is
somewhat simple or widely known, people
think you&#39;re missing something. You hear
that this is about affordability because
that&#39;s what people are feeling. And so
it is uh you know, housing costs have
gone up here in New Jersey by 50% over
the last 5 years. Electricity costs went
up 20% this summer. Uh we have some of
the highest property taxes in the
nation. And so all of that has led to um
a real focus on how Trent needs to work
better and addressing very specifically
I&#39;m going to declare a state of
emergency on energy costs on day one and
freeze rate hikes. Nobody&#39;s ever done
that before and I think people need to
see that as governor I mean business.
And it&#39;s not like oh I&#39;m going to
commission a study and in you know a
thousand years we&#39;ll do something. It&#39;s
day one. I&#39;m gonna stop this so you can
breathe a little bit as we continue to
put more power on the grid and drive
down costs, etc. So, it&#39;s a very
proactive focus on what you can do at
the state level as governor to address
people&#39;s needs. But I think uh you still
hear Chris, oh, you know, sometimes I&#39;ll
hear, oh, Mikey mentions Trump too much.
Well, I think what people might be
missing, what&#39;s different from 24 and
now is Trump is the president and he&#39;s
destroying the economy of the United
States. and attacking New Jersey. So, if
I ran a campaign where I didn&#39;t mention
that um he&#39;s running a worldwide
extortion scheme whereby tariffs go up
on every, you know, prices go up on
everyone here as he&#39;s made $5 billion,
then people might not understand that I
care about their grocery store prices or
their cup of coffee and what I&#39;m
battling to make sure eventually I can
drive that down. uh or if I didn&#39;t take
him on and say, &quot;Look, he&#39;s trying to
freeze funding that Congress has
appropriated for the Gateway Tunnel.&quot;
And 200,000 New Jerseyians take that
tunnel a day. They might not think I
really get what&#39;s at stake here. And so
he is the president now. and Democrats
do have to take him on. But I would
suggest and what is so far seems to be
successful here and we&#39;ll know more
November 4th is that when I take him on
it&#39;s very directly tied to people&#39;s
pocketbooks. And so while of course I
care deeply about our democracy and you
know I&#39;m disgusted by his AI videos and
I think the whole plan for the White
House is a histo major you know as a
historical building. Sure, I&#39;m upset
about it, but what I&#39;m running on and
what I&#39;m talking to people about is cost
and affordability and how I&#39;m going to
work to drive it down because there are
a lot of people that are lying awake at
night right now, not sure how they&#39;re
going to, you know, feed their family
and pay their rent. And so that&#39;s what
I&#39;m focused on. I I&#39;m curious how you
feel about this sort of what seems to be
a drift though in New Jersey towards
Donald Trump. Uh you know, Hillary won
New Jersey by 14 points in 2016. Joe
Biden by 16 points in 2020. Kla Harris
won by six points in in 2024. So, I
guess the question is, you know, clearly
there seems to be an erosion of some
Democratic support in New Jersey, and
I&#39;m wondering if you would explain uh,
you know, explain why you think that&#39;s
happening. You know, I think what
Democrats
have missed is because I think we often
see that Trump is acting in a way that&#39;s
co-opting power, that&#39;s undermining
people&#39;s opportunity, that&#39;s, you know,
um tearing down the ability of women to
succeed and people of color to succeed
and at the same time just white working
people to succeed. just really tearing
apart all the ways we&#39;ve generated
success for generations of people
and co-opting power in a way that&#39;s very
dangerous whereby he&#39;s having people
charged and arrested um without good
evidence anytime they go against him.
And all of this is is so beyond the pale
to so many of us that it it seems as if
you almost are saying like there&#39;s a
weird equivalency problem here, right?
We have a we have a um president who&#39;s
trying to become an autocrat and take
away opportunity for people versus, you
know, on one side and a a Republican
party that&#39;s done nothing about it and
then on the other side we have Democrats
who are maybe bumbling and incompetent.
But that&#39;s different, right? It it feels
different. But what people on the ground
are feeling is that they told Democrats
that their prices were too high and the
Democratic response was largely or the
Biden response was largely no look at
the stock market. It&#39;s fine. And then
Donald Trump said he would fix the
affordability problem and he&#39;s just
raised costs. So now you have an
electorate that&#39;s sort of in this
position of okay, Democrats didn&#39;t
deliver. And then I tried Republicans
and that, you know, you saw that in the
swing to the right and Trump hasn&#39;t
delivered. And so this has oddly been
one of the most nonpartisan elections
I&#39;ve run. And I know that sounds weird
in these partisan times, but um I go to
a lot of diners. I know it&#39;s cliche, but
I&#39;m a Jersey, you know, I&#39;m a Jersey
pouch here. So, I go to a lot of diners
and I talk to a lot of people and
historically in the red areas of my
state, I&#39;ll go in a diner and I&#39;ll talk
to a couple people and um tell them a
little bit about my campaign, but you
know, I&#39;ll find some people, you know, I
I like Trump or I&#39;m a Republican. Don&#39;t
talk to me kind of thing. This time,
nobody has really said that to me. One
woman, one and I mean I speak to
thousands of people day. One woman said,
&quot;I&#39;m a Republican. Um, so I won&#39;t be
voting for you, but good luck.&quot; That&#39;s
what she said to me. But that&#39;s it.
Everybody else is, &quot;Hm, how are you
going to lower my electricity costs?
What are you going to do about housing
costs here? What are you going to do
about property taxes?&quot; I I mean,
everyone&#39;s been open to that discussion.
I think people are searching for
a leader that they can trust to really
engage on those key issues for them. and
um and so that feels very different. And
I&#39;ll tell you the early vote, the vote
by mail and then we&#39;ve had two days of
early inerson voting seems to the vote
seems to be
um I I think we&#39;ll see a better result
than last year. I&#39;m knocking on wood
here. I get a little nervous talking
this close to the election. Um, I&#39;m not
sure how how much of I you know, I&#39;m not
looking I don&#39;t think we&#39;re looking at
like Hillary Clinton type numbers in New
Jersey, that kind of swing. But I do
think we&#39;re starting to build the, you
know, build the Democratic party back on
the ground. And a lot of that&#39;s through
working people um who just realize their
costs are going up and and Trump has
really destroyed their ability to
succeed. I&#39;m curious. You know,
obviously the Democrats are hoping
hoping and and people who are upset with
the Trump administration are hoping to
send a big message during the midterms
that they&#39;re not happy with the
direction of the country by, you know,
potentially changing Congress and and
electing more Democrats and we have all
these redistricting battles going on as
you well know. But I&#39;m curious if in
your campaign you&#39;re meeting people who
are Republicans and are potent, you
know, are are upset about the way the
Trump administration is doing business
and their vote for you is as much as
about their own pocketbooks as it is
about sort of the future of democracy.
Are you hearing, you know, you said
you&#39;re focusing on on, you know, kitchen
table issues, but are you hearing people
talk about that? Is is it resonating in
a statewide election, I guess, is what
I&#39;m curious about.
&gt;&gt; I think sometimes what people miss when
they&#39;re talking about issues of
democracy is that it&#39;s a little baked
in. So depending on how you look at the
democracy and and what&#39;s going on here
and if you have really strong feelings
on it, then you probably are a diehard
Democrat or a diehard Republican.
And so it&#39;s really what we&#39;re we&#39;re the
people we&#39;re talking to and the people
we need to make our case to are people
that generally vote on pocketbook
issues. That&#39;s why you&#39;ve just heard for
years, it&#39;s the economy, stupid. and and
yet you think, you know, and yet we hear
more about democracy because those are
people that are really focused um on
these issues and are deeply immersed in
it. But you&#39;re kind of
&gt;&gt; and we&#39;re also who are speaking out who
are trying it, right? Yet a lot of
people who are just trying to live their
lives and trying to make ends meet and
get their kids to school tune into the
election and are, you know, not aren&#39;t
focused on this daily for every, you
know, 365 days a year, but rather come
into an election and are like, &quot;Okay,
who&#39;s going to make my life better? And
I&#39;m struggling right now.&quot; And wow, um I
I just my grocery prices haven&#39;t gone
down. Oh, look, and now my gas is going
up and now we&#39;re not taking a vacation
this summer. So,
&gt;&gt; and now and now we may lose our
healthcare.
&gt;&gt; And now we may lose our healthcare. Now,
you know, so they&#39;re they&#39;re gauging who
is going to address that. And I&#39;ll tell
you, um, I I usually, you know, given my
congressional district, I usually win
with about a quarter of registered
Republicans in the swing, a large
portion of the swing vote. So, I don&#39;t
usually do that by um taking people on,
you know, so are you sorry you voted for
Trump? You know, how how do you like
that vote now? Look at your pass your
eggs. You know, I I don&#39;t kind of go
right there. But um I do hear, you know,
I I know the numbers in some of my
communities of who voted, who swung, and
I do think that a lot of the communities
that are very sensitive to tariffs are
taking a second look. So we&#39;ve seen, you
know, a lot of the numbers in the Latino
community where Republicans were saying
that they&#39;d really, you know, gotten
some good inroads into the Latino
community. Well, a lot of our community
here has a lot of trade with South
America and they have small businesses.
They import food, etc. So, they&#39;re very
cost-sensitive. They&#39;re small businesses
and we&#39;re seeing a swing back there.
um a lot of the Indian-American
community, Trump was in a really good
place with Modi, if you recall, and now
he&#39;s put 50% tariffs on India, which a
lot of the goods sold in um some of the
small businesses run by Indian-Americans
here in New Jersey are only found in
India. Some of the clothing and the
food. So, I think we are seeing some of
the bis the small business community
which is being really harmed by this
backing away. We&#39;d also though
anecdotally I just kept hearing about
all these young people swinging to the
right, you know, especially young men.
Young men were really going for Trump
and I, you know, I I have been speaking
to a lot of people getting ready to
graduate from college and the jobs have
dried up. And it&#39;s not just there&#39;s, you
know, people are worried about their job
prospects. It&#39;s people who had had a job
offer that has been rescended. I&#39;m not
sure everyone realizes how quickly this
economy has undergone such radical
destruction, but I&#39;ll tell you a little
bit over a year ago, I was hearing from
our businesses here that they needed to
expand and they needed a workforce. Now
I&#39;m hearing from mayors saying stuff
like, &quot;We had a jobs fair.
1500 people came out for five jobs. I
could hardly get employers there. Small
businesses because of these costs
associated with tariffs are going out of
business. they just can&#39;t pass enough
on, you know, it all on to their
customers. And then large businesses
instead of expanding as they were going
to do before Trump got into office have
been contracting just to, you know,
because it&#39;s kind of and and you can
shut me up if this goes down a boring a
boring rabbit hole, but it&#39;s fascinating
to me, you know, as I talked to these
big businesses, one of them was telling
me a big New Jersey company, they have a
whole uh North American market. And so
Trump said, &quot;Reshore American
manufacturing.&quot; That&#39;s where he was
going. So they reshore American
manufacturing
and yet then and they had had
manufacturing up in Canada. They reshore
it. Trump gets into a big tariff war. So
he gives he puts tariffs on Canada.
Canada does reverse tariffs and then
Canadians don&#39;t buy American. So
suddenly their North American business
is a disaster
because they thought they read what
Trump was going to do correctly, but
it&#39;s so chaotic. You really can&#39;t plan
for this. So now instead of trying to
game the system out anymore, they&#39;re
just like, &quot;Look, we&#39;re just
contracting. We&#39;re laying people off and
we&#39;re going to try to wait this one
out.&quot; So that&#39;s why you see even big
corporations are suddenly contracting.
That&#39;s why you see the reports. 22 I
think states are in recession right now
already. So it&#39;s happened really quickly
and I think people are just starting to
realize the impacts of it. I think as
you said there&#39;s a lot of uncertainty
and that makes it very difficult for
businesses to plan for the future you
know and the sort of on again offag
again what will happen next is is a
really difficult environment I know for
small businesses I wanted to ask you
about ICE raids because it seems
governors across the country have really
become front and center if you look at
JB Pritsker for example in Illinois and
and what&#39;s happening in Chicago. I know
that New Jersey is home to nearly 2
million immigrants and refugees and uh
you have sought to ban ICE agents from
covering their faces. But how else I if
you&#39;re elected uh Congresswoman, would
you address the administration&#39;s attacks
on immigrants? You know, I recently read
that 170 US citizens have been held by
immigration agents. This was from
ProPublica and the headline is they&#39;ve
been kicked, dragged, and detained for
days. Obviously, uh, civil rights
advocates are arguing about the lack of
due process in these raids, the violence
of them, this family separation, etc.,
etc. And I&#39;m just curious, is there
anything you could actually do if you&#39;re
elected about this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So this is exactly where I think
those of us who&#39;ve served around the
world as I have in the military
understood this was headed. Uh when you
start to see these attacks, it doesn&#39;t
end with people who are undocumented. It
the president was co-opting so much
power and then putting together these
forces and hiring up ICE agents um
really really quickly and forming um you
know what I would call a secret police
force. I&#39;m hearing in DHS that they&#39;re
taking loyalty oaths to the
administration, not the Constitution.
So, it&#39;s really dangerous. And and so I,
you know, I kept telling people, you
should all be worried about this because
it doesn&#39;t end here. It ends as the
president starts to attack enemies of
the state as they would be called in
other countries around the world where
people start to be disappeared in the
middle of the night. And we&#39;re already
seeing that, as you said, with US
citizens. And I&#39;ve heard parents telling
kids, parents who are citizens and
children who are citizens telling their
children to carry their passport with
them and afraid that they might get
picked up um and detained. And so it&#39;s a
really scary time, which is why I have
said here in New Jersey, I&#39;m going to
make sure that along with our public
safety officers, people can go to church
safely, they can go to school safely,
they can go to healthcare appointments
safely, they can report crime safely.
And part of the reason I&#39;m so adamant
about having agents be identifiable is I
I don&#39;t know if everyone has kind of
contextualize what&#39;s happening. Um, so I
was talking to a police officer here who
was telling me about in his town he came
upon a guy, as he put it, dressed like
he was going to Afghanistan.
So here you have these people who are
just hired really, really quickly to
start to get into this um agency. I
don&#39;t know that they&#39;re given much
training and then they&#39;re kitted out
with all kinds of weapons. They&#39;ve got
masks on. You can&#39;t tell who they are.
They&#39;re not identifiable. So he went up
to the guy and he said, &quot;Who are you?
Give me some ID. You know, you&#39;re in my
town and you&#39;re carrying weapons.
Imagine if you&#39;re walking with your kid
down the street and this person&#39;s like
in front of the grocery store.&quot; So, uh,
the guy goes, &quot;I don&#39;t have to show you
anything.&quot; And he goes, &quot;Well, then I&#39;m
going to take you to jail.&quot; And this guy
goes, &quot;Well, then I&#39;m going to take you
to jail.&quot; And the police officer goes,
&quot;Fine. We&#39;ll fight it out in jail. It&#39;s
my town, buddy.&quot; And, uh, finally he
shows him some ID. He was an ICE agent.
But I mean that&#39;s unacceptable. So
that&#39;s why as governor I&#39;m going to
empower our police to keep people here
safe and continue to fight some of
what&#39;s going on here in court because
you&#39;re exactly right. There are no due
process uh there&#39;s a violation of
different due process rights. Um there
are grave concerns about who people are
picking up, people who are here legally
and the community is very afraid and and
I you know there&#39;s the whole public
safety. There&#39;s the fear that I hate I
hate to think that our community is
afraid or people can&#39;t sleep at night or
people are worried about their kids
coming home to an empty house if they
get picked up. I mean that is
unacceptable. But I also I mean we&#39;re
also seeing a hu as a huge attack on the
economy. um people are afraid to go to
work. We&#39;re seeing people not show up at
the port. We have the one of the biggest
ports in uh nation. So, it&#39;s really um
it it&#39;s really the opposite of what any
good government would do or good
planning would lead you to do. And then
we have that that&#39;s just one aspect of
it. The other thing is the National
Guard troops and then the president
saying he wants to use our cities as
training grounds for our military. And
so, um, we&#39;ve seen great success with,
um, governors taking this to court in
California and Oregon and Illinois to
show that this is illegal and get rid of
the National Guard troops. But you won&#39;t
see that if you have Republican
governors. And then I would just flag
finally, and along these lines, we&#39;ve
also had we have the DOJ now coming into
two states, and it&#39;s California, New
Jersey. And I don&#39;t know if your viewers
or or listeners know, but California now
has Prop 50 on the ballot.
&gt;&gt; Um, which is basically Why don&#39;t you
explain what Prop 50 is?
&gt;&gt; So, Trump is a Trump is redistricting um
to cheat the election system in the
midterms. So, he&#39;s calling So, largely
um, as my mom might say, no good deed
goes unpunished. So, largely Democratic
states decided to do bipartisan fair
redistricting. um Republican states kept
the partisan redistricting going. So um
what Trump has done is go to all the
Republican state governors and say,
&quot;Look, just redistrict and make me some
new districts so I can win, you know,
hold the majority.&quot; Um and several of
the Democratic states who have to go
through a different process to
redistrict um with input from the
people. So, Prop 50 would allow um would
allow California
to redistrict
uh because Texas has redistricted. I
believe it was based on that if I
remember.
&gt;&gt; Right. It was. Yes.
&gt;&gt; So, this is the this is a ballot measure
that the people of California will vote
on uh for their redistricting. They put
forward some redistricting.
And so, and then New Jersey is one of
only two states with a competitive
election. And so, um, Trump is putting
DOJ monitors in California and New
Jersey. Um, and we have a US attorney
here, Alen Haba, who has said that she
is going to turn New Jersey red. So,
it&#39;s, um, as you can imagine, I think an
attempt to really attack the vote here
suggests it&#39;s not fair, um, as Trump
tries to undermine faith in our
democracy. But, we&#39;ve worked really hard
to run a fair election system. And I
think if anything this will get more
people out to vote because New
Jerseyians don&#39;t really like to be
threatened like that. So I think I think
this might activate some people um and
and get them out to the polls.
&gt;&gt; I live in New York City. Uh and I have
to ask you about this ad that&#39;s been
running on a loop as you well know. Uh
it was when you struggled to answer a
local New New York uh reporter who asked
you if you could pass one piece of
legislation, what would it be? I
wondered if you could take me back to
that moment and I&#39;m sure you&#39;d like to
do that interview again, Mike. Um so I I
if you would like a doover, I&#39;d love to
re ask you that question. If you could
pass one piece of legislation, what
would it be? And I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve thought
about this many times like I should have
said this, I should have said that.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. Yes. Well, as you might
have heard, affordability is the key
issue here. So that&#39;s why um I am going
to immediately as I said put a freeze on
rate hikes but it will take legislation
in the budget to pass money to um
modernize our natural gas facilities to
um end some of the regulatory and
permitting framework that&#39;s keeping us
from putting solar onto our closed uh
landfills and rooftops. So, I&#39;ll get
that done right away in legislation, as
well as adding battery storage to some
of the areas where we can connect them
rapidly. Um, and then expand in the
budget the um the first-time home buyers
program so that people can get into a
home because right now that&#39;s a huge
issue. as well as um legislation to take
on the PBMs. Those are those middlemen
in uh drug pricing that are driving up
some of the pharmaceutical prices up to
by 10 10 times. So really housing,
health care, utilities, those are the
key issues that I hear about and the key
uh pieces of legislation I&#39;ll
immediately pass so we can really
continue to work to drive costs down.
when you answered the way you did
afterwards were you like did you do a
whole Homer Simpson like do kind of
&gt;&gt; I just you know I I feel like that might
have been one of the first interviews
right there and I was just so mad at
myself. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Well, I I I&#39;m glad I got an opportunity
to ask you that question again because I
think you you it&#39;s pretty clear what you
want to do. I wanted to ask you about uh
how your opponent&#39;s campaign filed for
access to your military records and the
national archives then gave them your
full personnel record largely unredacted
turned it over to reporters. Uh I guess
the campaign Chidarelli&#39;s campaign then
turned it over to reporters. Um what did
you think of that? Uh what kind of legal
action have you taken? And I understand
his campaign is now under federal
investigation. Can you bring us up to
speed on that? And hey, are you having
fun running for governor?
&gt;&gt; This, you know,
New Jersey is known for rough campaigns,
but uh but certainly my opponent and and
Trump really go outside the pale of
anything you would expect. But I guess
uh this is the new normal,
unfortunately. we just really have to
keep fighting it with everything we&#39;ve
got so that we can um take, you know,
take back the presidency and the House
and the Senate. And of course, the
president&#39;s already saying he&#39;s going to
illegally try to stay in office. So,
it&#39;s really important that we continue
to find ways to push back. But
unfortunately, um my opponent sent
someone to get my military records. And
that person was told, &quot;No, this is um
you know, this is has privacy protected,
so you would need to have a social
security. I would need to sign for.&quot; And
then so this was probably this was right
before the primary, but a couple days
two days after the primary, this person
went back and found somebody um who was
willing to give him the records. I&#39;m
sure he&#39;d been told to call. So uh that
person then someone at the archives had
to have my social. So what they did was
they went into a a government VA
database to pull my social so they could
get access to my military records. And
then they were supposed to have a
signature, which they didn&#39;t have. They
were supposed to notify the Navy that
they were le releasing them, which they
didn&#39;t do. They just dumped it onto this
person from Jack Chidarelli&#39;s campaign
who said he was shocked and disgusted to
see my unredacted social security
number, to see my um parents unredacted
information on my 80-year-old parents
address, etc. and yet instead of
flagging that this was a problem as with
his shock and disgust decided to instead
turn it over to a journalist. And um so
I&#39;ve had veterans from across the state
saying, you know, you really need to
protect records. I need you to be
governor. I need you to protect records.
And then some stuff a as I was going I
had been hearing from a lot of seniors
because they&#39;ve been very worried about
their social security information being
released by Doge. And then I was talking
to Josh Shapiro who&#39;s the governor of
Pennsylvania and he was telling me about
how the Trump administration had
demanded that he turn over all of the
voting files. And the voting files
include um social security numbers and
driver&#39;s license information um driver&#39;s
license numbers and addresses. And he
had said no. He they&#39;re in court now
fighting it out. But I since have
learned that some governors, Republican
governors are turning that over to
Donald Trump, which is really scary to
me, thinking of how he might be using
that um in an attempt to attack people
and and um sort of cheat the system and
the vote.
&gt;&gt; Good times.
&gt;&gt; It is. It is like times we haven&#39;t seen.
But that&#39;s why um it&#39;s why I&#39;m running,
you know. I I mean if it&#39;s just these
these I think governors are really
standing in the breach now. Um I told
you I was talking to Shapiro about that.
Gavin Newsome is telling me how he&#39;s out
in California. He&#39;s making insulin. He&#39;s
having a factory in California make
insulin because Trump is so screwing up
the supply chains and um not driving
down cost. Um Mara Healey is helping in
the northeastern part of the United
States to set up um a coalition of
states uh that I will work with her on
as governor to make sure we&#39;re getting
good medical data out that people have
access to vaccines and that insurance
companies pay for them in the wake of
RFK Jr. But this is this is how we&#39;ve
got to go forward. Um, I, you know, I
have a big pharmaceutical manufacturing
base and I&#39;ve had people tell me
without, with this FDA, they&#39;re not sure
how they&#39;re getting new drugs to market.
It is really dire and I think it&#39;s going
to have to be governors that take the
lead here.
&gt;&gt; Well, I really appreciate your time. I
know that you have to go. As I said,
tomorrow is will be one week away from
election day. early voting is happening
and I&#39;m sure you have many people that
you still want to meet and talk to. So,

Substack interview. We have a really
great Substack community of smart people
who are really interested in hearing
longer conversations with people like
