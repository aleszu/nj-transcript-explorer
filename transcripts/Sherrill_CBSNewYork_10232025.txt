New Jersey will elect a new governor in
less than two weeks, and the candidates
couldn&#39;t be further apart on their
vision for the Garden State. New Jersey
reporter Christine Sloan recently sat
down with Republican Jack Chidarelli and
Democrat Mikey Cheryl to talk about the
issues and what sets them apart from
their opponent. She met Cheryl at a
small business in Jersey City. I met
Democrat Mikey Cheryl at a Jersey City
bakery where she told me she feels
confident with former President Barack
Obama coming to campaign with her and
now receiving endorsements from some
black clergy members.
&gt;&gt; Well, obviously the black clergy is
really important. Um they are such
leaders in the community.
&gt;&gt; Are you concerned about voters getting
out?
&gt;&gt; Um at this point we are seeing really
good returns in the vote by mail. I know
you mention President Trump a lot in
your commercials and here. Is there a
danger of focusing so much on the
president rather than the issues in New
Jersey?
&gt;&gt; I think many of the issues are connected
to the president because Jack supports
these the ways the president&#39;s
destroying our economy.
&gt;&gt; We talked about the issues New Jersey
voters face including high property
taxes.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s really breaking the back of too
many families. So, while this has been a
high cost state and I&#39;ve always been
working hard to get rid of the state
local tax deduction cap, I&#39;ll increase
that firsttime home buyers program so
people can get a foot in the door. I
know part of your property tax plan um
is to perhaps um consolidate school
districts. How do you think that&#39;s going
to go with people in the suburbs who
want home rule?
&gt;&gt; So, I think what people want to see is
their property taxes going down. We have
more municipalities than California and
we have more school districts than
municipalities and so we want our money
as as taxpayers. We want our money going
to our kids. Jack Chidarelli earlier
said that you&#39;re lying about him want
wanting to institute a 10% tax.
&gt;&gt; You don&#39;t have to go with my word for
it. Look at his record.
&gt;&gt; And I just want to reiterate, will you
raise the sales tax or any other tax?
&gt;&gt; I won&#39;t raise the sales tax.
&gt;&gt; Some of her education plan. As governor,
I am going to make sure we&#39;re continuing
to fund teachers education and phonics
based reading um and use evidence-based
uh skills to help children read at third
grade level and get those scores up on
skyrocketing utility bills. I&#39;m going to
freeze rate hikes as we drive massive
amounts of power and through solar,
through battery storage, through
improving our natural gas
infrastructure, and in the long term
through nuclear power. As you have
heard, many say that perhaps what you
are saying about freezing those rate
hikes is unconstitutional. Do you think
you will be able to do that?
&gt;&gt; I do. In fact, when I put out that I was
going to do that, um, we saw an open
letter coming in from the utility
company saying they want to work with me
on these rates.
&gt;&gt; The Gateway Tunnel project, another
topic during the government shutdown.
President Trump threatening to terminate
it.
&gt;&gt; I am going to fight this tooth and nail.
The mom of four also says she&#39;ll take on
any landlord colluding to drive up rents
in Jersey City. Christine Sloan, CBS
News New York. And tomorrow at 5:30,
watch Christine&#39;s conversation with
Republican candidate Jack Chidarelli.
