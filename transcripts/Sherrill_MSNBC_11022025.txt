New Jersey&#39;s governor race is shaping up
as one of three key gauges on how voters
feel about the first year of Trump&#39;s
second presidency and whether Democrats
have improved their standing ahead of
the 2026 midterms. As of now, Democratic
nominee Mikey Cheryl holds a narrow lead
over Trump backed Republican Jack
Chidarelli by seven points. Now, while
New Jersey traditionally leans blue in
general elections, Republican governors
in the Garden State aren&#39;t actually that
rare. But there have been growing signs
of a further shift to the right in
recent years. In 2021, for example,
sitting Democratic Governor Phil Murphy
won reelection narrowly against
Chidarelli by just over three points.
For comparison sake, Murphy won the
state in 2017 by 14 points. And in 2024,
Kla Harris carried New Jersey by only
six points. That was the narrowest
presidential win for a Democrat in the
state since 1992.
So, will this right-leaning trend
continue Tuesday, or will Democrats
hopes of this race being a referendum on
Trump pay off? Joining us now to
discuss, Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl, the
Democratic nominee in the new New Jersey
governor&#39;s race, and Senator Andy Kim of
New Jersey. Thank you both for joining
us. I know you have a busy day.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman, um,
&gt;&gt; thanks so much for having us.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman, Democrats have lost
ground in your state in recent
elections. What is your closing message
for, let&#39;s say, Biden Trump voters or
Murphy Trump voters?
So, my message has been uh what I&#39;ve
built over the past year after listening
to thousands of New Jerseyians, and
that&#39;s that I am going to be
relentlessly focused on driving costs
down here, both in Trenton when it comes
to electricity prices and declaring a
state of emergency on day one, housing
prices, healthcare prices, and I&#39;m going
to fight all the attacks coming from
Washington, which we&#39;ve seen from the
tariffs and the one big beautiful bill
and then the threats to freeze the
gateway tunnel project. So, at every
turn, uh, my opponent is going right
along with Trump raising prices. I&#39;m
focused on driving families costs down.
&gt;&gt; Senator, let me pick up on that point
that we just heard there about the kind
of closing message. You, uh, performed
much better than the former vice
president, Kla Harris, did in the state.
You actually won your Senate race by
nearly 10 points. What is your advice to
the congresswoman ahead of Tuesday&#39;s uh,
vote in terms of how to get it across
the finish line?
Well, Congressman Congresswoman Cheryl
is is one of the best at closing a
campaign. She is a general election
juggernaut. Uh but we have talked about
this before absolutely about tackling
low cost. Right now, because of Trump,
because of these Republicans not
extending the Affordable Care Act,
healthc care subsidies, people in New
Jersey on the marketplace are going to
see a 174% increase in their costs. We
right now have 880,000
New Jerseyians that are not getting food
assistance because Donald Trump refuses
to spend the money that he should be
required to spend. So it&#39;s about this
effort of, you know, Donald Trump is not
lowering your costs. He&#39;s actually
making things worse with the tariffs
that are out there raising prices. He&#39;s
more interested in building up his own
net worth than actually focused on you.
You know, Donald Trump has made billions
of dollars for his family since January
20th. How much money has your family
made? And I think the answer to that is
very clear in terms of where uh who is
focused on lowering cost. And right now
here, it&#39;s Mikey Cheryl.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman Cheryl. Trump&#39;s DOJ says
that they&#39;re going to be sending
election monitors into your state.
There&#39;s concern particularly in
communities of color, communities with
immigrant families in, you know, cities
like Newark. What is your team doing to
prepare for the presence of DOJ
officials in your state? What are you
going to be looking out for? And what
message do you have to people who are
worried about their ability to go to the
polls and what that might mean for them?
&gt;&gt; Well, we have the largest field team
that&#39;s ever been run here in New Jersey.
So, we pulled out a significant early
vote and vote by mail. We built a a
great blue wall as we head into election
day. Um, and then we will be ensuring
that we get every single vote out on
election day. Early vote just closed
earlier today. So, we&#39;re getting the
final vote by mails in and then early
vote or and then election day voting.
And I have to tell you, um, you know,
this is this is not surprising. This is
basically what President Trump has said
he&#39;s going to do. Alina Haba, our
attorney, our US attorney, has said that
she&#39;s working to turn New Jersey red.
And Trump is trying to cheat the
election for next year by redistricting
across the nation. So, it&#39;s pretty clear
that they really want to impact the vote
here. But I have to tell you, this is
not the way you do it with New
Jerseyians. If anything, I think this
has just really angered people across
the state, and I think more people will
turn out because of it. Congresswoman,
you&#39;ve made affordability a central part
of your closing message and electricity
costs in New Jersey have gone up 20%
just over the past year. You have said
you&#39;re going to freeze the cost of
electricity. Could you explain, you
know, you&#39;re going to declare a state of
emergency and then how does this get
paid for? Do you negotiate with the
private sector utilities? What are the
specifics of the plan?
Exactly. So, we have seen an alphabet
soup of agencies kicking the can down
the road in New Jersey and then dumping
the rate hikes on the rate payers here.
We&#39;ve also seen Trump threaten um higher
utility price because of the fact that
fossil fuel companies donated $250
million to his campaign. So, he&#39;s
cancelelling a lot of energy uh projects
that we have to push a greater energy
into our grid. So, that&#39;s why I said
enough. Uh on day one, I&#39;m declaring a
state of emergency. I&#39;ve already had the
utility companies say in an open letter
that they want to work with me on
lowering those price hikes as well as
some of the money that comes in through
the BPU from Reggie that we can use to
offset some of these costs. At the same
time, it&#39;s going to take a big fight to
continue to get more electricity into
our grid with Trump threatening it at
every turn and trying to remove some of
the support that we&#39;ve seen for projects
like solar on landfills and on um
rooftop solar, more battery storage,
transmission changes that we need to
upgrade our grid. All of these things
we&#39;re seeing trumps. So, as governor,
I&#39;m going to continue to drive more
power into New Jersey, drive down costs,
and at the same time fight back against
any attempts from the federal government
to undermine our our push for more power
in New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; Senator, the shutdown has also affected
um the airline industry in your state as
well as air traffic controllers. Air
traffic controllers, for example,
received a Z paycheck despite having to
show up for work daytoday um even as the
government is shut down. and there were
significant delays at Newark this week.
As someone who sits on the Senate
Transportation Committee, what is your
plan to help alleviate these problems,
both the paychecks uh that have not been
received because of the shutdown as well
as the congestion and delays at one of
the nation&#39;s major airports?
This is so important and we have to make
sure that our air traffic controllers
and our public servants are are not seen
as collateral damage in this brokenness
that we&#39;re seeing when the Republicans
refusing to negotiate right now. You
know, we&#39;ve pushed forward on
legislation that would pay all of our
air traffic controllers, all of our
public servants, many of them working
right now without getting a paycheck.
But what we&#39;ll say is we just continue
to see a problem because whatever
legislation, even if we&#39;re able to
negotiate and pass it through the
Senate, there&#39;s no one on the other side
of the capital right now because Speaker
Johnson refuses to convene the House of
Representatives. It&#39;s been well over 40
days. I mean, I I can&#39;t even imagine. I
go around New Jersey. I tell people,
&quot;What would happen if you didn&#39;t show up
to your job in 40 days?&quot; Uh, you know,
this is an abdication of leadership. We
should be having negotiations so that we
can get this legislation through, make
sure that we pay our air traffic
controllers, our public servants. I used
to be a federal government employee.
I&#39;ve worked through uh shutdowns before
without getting a paycheck. I understand
how hard it is. And you know, the last
thing I&#39;ll just say is that as I&#39;ve
talked to federal workers, they have
reminded me that the problems that they
faced didn&#39;t just start on October 1st.
It started on January 20th with this
administration devastating our public
service, uh, our government, firing
hundreds of thousands of workers. Uh,
they feel under attacked this entire
time and they want to make sure that we
stand up for their rights. Um, I have a
question for both of you, but I&#39;ll begin
with you, Congresswoman, which is, you
know, the other element of, uh, what
we&#39;re seeing right now is there are, you
know, residents of your state who are
dependent on food assistance who are
going to be going without, maybe
wondering how they&#39;re going to budget,
put food on the table, send their kids
to school with a full belly in the next
few days, and that, I could imagine, may
impact their ability to feel their
voices are heard and they&#39;re able to
participate in election. I think if
you&#39;re worried about food, you know,
your electoral issues may start to kind
of fall down the list. What&#39;s your
message to the residents of your state
who are nervous about what this lapse in
benefits may mean for them, worried
about where they&#39;re going to get food
and support in the coming days? and you
know your message for for this moment,
the sort of immediate next few days, but
also for the long term, how you&#39;re going
to support families who are looking at
these massive cuts from this
administration that are going to impact
them for months and years to come.
So, you know, I was just at a food line
yesterday and voters are well aware that
this administration is impacting their
cost of living at every level from food
assistance to the tariffs which are
driving up cost of everything to um the
one big beautiful bill which is
threatening their healthcare and for
those that can still hold on to their
healthcare driving up costs so high in
the marketplace that they&#39;re worried
they won&#39;t be able to continue to pay
those premiums. So at every level,
voters here, including people on food
assistance, are well aware that this
administration has not only not
fulfilled any of its commitments to
lower prices, but in fact is raising
prices at every turn. So that too is
another reason why this election is so
important here in New Jersey. I&#39;m
committed to taking care of everyone in
this state. I&#39;m committed to making sure
people in our state don&#39;t go hungry. and
the fact that the president of the
United States, as he lines his pockets
with billions of dollars, is withholding
the six billion dollars he should be
putting towards this food aid to fulfill
his commitment for the rest of the
month. So, I uh New Jersey is in a
lawsuit to make him do just that. I will
continue that lawsuit as governor if
need be. But at the same time, we&#39;re
also in a state of emergency here to
surge food to as many people as we can.
um you know, cutting through red tape
and and regulations to get that food to
people as quickly as possible because we
we really want to take care of people as
the president of the United States is
seeking to harm so many vulnerable
families.
&gt;&gt; Can I pick up on that?
&gt;&gt; Jump in just
&gt;&gt; Oh, please go ahead, Senator. Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; Yes. I I just I just have to say this,
which is that as I hope they&#39;re also
seeing it&#39;s not just about Donald Trump.
It&#39;s about who&#39;s going to be our next
governor. And I have to say when Jack
Chidarelli says that he would give he
gives Donald Trump an A rating. I mean
really an A rating for 800,000 New
Jerseyians not getting food assistance.
An A rating for 174% increase in healthc
care costs. An A rating for Donald Trump
terminating the Gateway Tunnel project
which is vital for so many people in
this New Jersey. These kind of mob boss
tactics that Donald Trump is doing. So,
you know, again, it is just something
where we see Jack Chitter Chitterelli so
clearly focus on himself. You know, he&#39;s
been running for governor longer than my
kids have been alive. You know, he&#39;s in
it for the job. He&#39;s he really willing
to just bend the knee and kiss the ring
of Donald Trump. And that is the last
thing that we need here in New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman, really quickly, I mean,
to pick up on that point by the senator,
if Jack Chidurelli is kissing the ring
of Donald Trump, why do you think Donald
Trump has not leaned in more into this
particular race? It&#39;s a little bit
closer than other races, but he doesn&#39;t
he&#39;s not campaigning for the candidate.
He doesn&#39;t seem to be um as vested in it
as uh you know as he is in other issues
right now in the country, ballrooms and
crypto it seems. But why do you think
he&#39;s not out there campaigning in your
state?
&gt;&gt; You know, this is as as I think Senator
Kim just said, Jack Chadelli is a
perennial candidate around here. This is
the third time he&#39;s running for
governor. I think the president tries to
stay away from races he doesn&#39;t think uh
are going to be winnable and so that
might be one of the reasons he&#39;s not on
the ground here in New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; All right, Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl
and Senator Andy Kim. Great to have both
of you. Really appreciate. I know you
have a very busy schedule so it means a
lot to us. Thank you.
