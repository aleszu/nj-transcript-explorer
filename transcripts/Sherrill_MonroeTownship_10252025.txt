Wow,
it is great to see all of you.
How is everybody tonight?
Thank you all so much for coming out
this morning. It is great to see you.
Um, I have to tell you,
I have been going
all over this state talking to thousands
of people about what&#39;s at stake here.
And I have to say, I am so happy to see
all of you here taking this
responsibility seriously. Thank you.
Thank you for coming up this morning. I
want to thank Governor Josh Shapiro. How
fantastic is it that he came over
Kevin
for leading the fight here in Middle Sex
County. Thank you everyone. Thanks to
all our electeds. Thank you everyone for
coming out. I I got to say I&#39;ve thought
a lot about what is going on in this
country. I&#39;m sure you all have um and
what it really means. And I keep coming
back to this idea that this is about
opportunity.
who has access to it, who gets a seat at
the table and who doesn&#39;t. And for my
entire life, this country has opened up
opportunity. We&#39;ve never been perfect.
Nobody said we had a perfect union.
We&#39;ve always been fighting for a more
perfect union,
advancing opportunity, opening it up for
people. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen in my own
family. You know, my mom&#39;s side of the
family lost everything in the Great
Depression. My grandpa&#39;s dad lost his
job, lost their house, they had to move
back onto the farm. And yet, after the
war, my grandpa got a good union job.
And because of that job, he was able to
put my family squarely into the middle
class. I look at that job as part of the
reason I am here with you today. And it
didn&#39;t stop there. It was on my dad&#39;s
side of the family. You know, he grew up
poor in West Virginia. By the time he
was 13, both of his parents had died.
And yet, he was able to work hard and
put himself through college. And back in
those days, he didn&#39;t go into debt for
30 years. He was able to get a good job.
That is another reason that my family
has been put squarely into the middle
class. But it didn&#39;t stop there. It&#39;s
not some stories from my grandparents or
from my parents. I&#39;ve seen it in my own
life because when I told my dad that I
wanted to be a Navy pilot, that I wanted
to go to the Naval Academy, he looked at
me and he kind of shook his head and
said, &quot;You know what? Like I I don&#39;t
know
if the Naval Academy takes women
and I don&#39;t know if the Navy has women
pilots.
But I knew what this country
represented. I knew that this country
expanded opportunity. I knew that
because my parents had told me that. My
teachers had told me that. I learned it
on Saturday morning cartoons when I
watched Schoolhouse Rock. I knew
I knew that this country created
opportunity and I knew I could fulfill
my dreams. And sure enough, by the time
I graduated from the Naval Academy, I
graduated in the first class of women
eligible for combat on ships and
aircraft.
And that&#39;s sort of been my fight.
Expanding opportunity,
serving the community, working hard, and
fighting for New Jerseyians.
And there are too many people that
haven&#39;t had a seat at the table. And
yet, we were on a path to make sure
everybody did, to make sure every child
here got a good education regardless of
zip code. to make sure we extended
healthcare to everyone. So you had
quality and affordable healthcare to
make sure people had a pathway to a good
job to building something for their
family and maybe then their kids would
do just a little bit better than they
did. That is what we have been on the
path to creating
and that
is what&#39;s at stake in this election
because everything I just described
is being attacked by Donald Trump and my
opponent Jack Chidarelli
as he tries to take away healthcare, as
he tries to freeze the funding for the
Gateway Tunnel project, as he tries to
raise electricity cost. At every turn,
Jack Chidarelli has given him an A.
&gt;&gt; An A.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all sitting down because
you are going to be shocked to hear that
I give the president of the United
States an F.
So, as I am fighting incredibly hard for
people to lower cost, I&#39;m going to
freeze those rate hikes on day one by
declaring a state of emergency.
We&#39;re going to cut through red tape and
permanent delays, saving you time and
money. I&#39;m going to make sure to expand
that firsttime home buyers programs so
people can get a foot in the door, build
their famil family&#39;s wealth, but at the
same time, I&#39;m going to take on those
landlords who are colluding to drive up
rental prices.
And as I&#39;m trying to lower cost, we see
a tariff program. I call it a worldwide
extortion racket. Because as you pay
more from everything from your cup of
coffee to the groceries you buy,
President Trump and his family have
pocketed billions.
&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve seen the latest
numbers, but the deficit went up by a
trillion dollars, the fastest it&#39;s ever
increased in about a little over 70 days
under President Trump.
So, how is it that the deficit is rising
at that rate and we are spending that
kind of money and yet all of us are
paying more for everything?
That&#39;s what we&#39;re fighting. We&#39;re
fighting for opportunity. We&#39;re fighting
for affordability. We&#39;re fighting for
our kids to make sure that they have a
better future.
This is what we&#39;re doing here in New
Jersey. And this is why this election
matters.
So today
is a pretty special day.
Today we are not only 10 days out from
the election, but this is the first day
of early inerson voting.
&gt;&gt; So does everybody know where the Monroe
Library is here?
&gt;&gt; All right. It&#39;s about five miles away.
All right. So, I want everybody who
hasn&#39;t voted yet, if you don&#39;t vote by
mail, this is your day. This is the day
to vote because I&#39;m going to let you
guys in on a secret.
New Jersey is not a red state.
New Jersey is not even a purple state.
&gt;&gt; I have seen the voter registration
numbers. So, I can tell you with a great
degree of confidence that New Jersey is
a blue state.
&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;m going to leave you with this.
If we vote, we win.
&gt;&gt; If we vote, we win. If we vote for
Jersey, we win. Thank you all so much. I
really appreciate it. Thank you.
Don&#39;t come back.
