mo, as George HW Bush would say,
momentum. You really think a Republican
can win in New Jersey?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, Lee. People across the state
have had it. Eight years of failed
policies of the current administration,
all of which have been endorsed by my
opponent. The energy has been off the
charts. The reception in minority
communities has been overwhelmingly
positive. Uh, tonight we had a
magnificent teley town hall with the
president on which thousands of people
participated. and the point you made,
I&#39;m getting endorsed by Democratic
mayors all around the state. That&#39;s a
really positive sign we&#39;re going to win.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh Mikey Cheryl has branded
herself, or at least people who support
her brand her as sort of the future of
the Democratic party, quote unquote
centrist, um military background, former
helicopter pilot. Just ask her, she&#39;ll
tell you. Uh and says the Democratic
Party has moved to the center. I&#39;m
wondering if that is true, why things
are even close for you.
It&#39;s one of the big lies in this
campaign and we&#39;ve pointed it out. She
supported Joe Biden&#39;s open border
policies, supported his inflationary
policies, voted no on the Lake and Riley
Act, voted yes twice to allow biological
boys to participate in girls sports,
voted no on the big beautiful bill,
which puts $5,000 a year back in the
pocket of the average middle class
family all throughout New Jersey.
Supports sanctuary cities. Us being a
sanctuary state, that&#39;s no centrist,
Leland. Okay, we have offered uh
obviously and asked her many times to
come and appear on the program. That
offer uh stands for her. Uh in that
spirit though, I want to play um one of
her criticisms of you. This is uh Mikey
Cheryl on the Gateway Project October
8th. Take a listen.
&gt;&gt; Jack won&#39;t say one cross word about the
president. Even when he froze gateway
tunnel funding, Jack said that&#39;s not a
New Jersey problem. Well, I beg to
differ, as do the over 200,000 people a
day that ride that rail system into that
tunnel.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll give you the opportunity now. Is
there anything you disagree with
President Trump about?
&gt;&gt; So, Leland, this is somebody who voted
yes for the continuing resolutions to
get the government open when Joe Biden
was the president. And now she&#39;s voting
no on continuing resolutions because
Trump is the president. If she cares
that much about the Gateway Project,
vote yes on the uh on the continuing
resolutions, get the government open
again. But the fact of the matter is the
Gateway Project does not come to an end.
It&#39;s managed by the Gateway Commission,
which is flush with cash. It seeks
reimbursement from the federal
government from time to time. The
shutdown would need to go on for another
two months before that project would
come to a stop. It&#39;s another big lie in
her campaign.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I I I understand I&#39;m not well
verssed in the Gateway Tunnel project. I
know it&#39;s important in New Jersey, but I
I think you may have missed the question
that I asked, which is uh her criticism
of you is that Jack won&#39;t say one cross
word about the president. Um obviously
you view yourself as separate from
Donald Trump. Is there anything
policy-wise that you&#39;d want to make the
point here that you disagree with Trump
on?
&gt;&gt; Uh I agree with him on securing the
border. I agree what he did with New
Jersey in terms of putting a halt to the
wind farms off the Jersey shore. I mean,
the big beautiful bill does great things
for middle class people. Um, you know,
was I happy with the administration when
they were saying that a city medicine
caused autism. Uh, if pregnant mothers
took the, uh, took the medicine. There
wasn&#39;t really any medical research to
that. So, but listen, he&#39;s been great
for New Jersey. Um, he did really well
in New Jersey last year and we&#39;re just
going to continue to go out there and
talk about the issues.
&gt;&gt; Okay. U, I think there was an answer
there somewhere. I guess you disagreed
with him on the Tylenon autism thing. I
wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street
Journal about it, so I think it&#39;s an
issue important to you and me. Let me
ask you this, though. Um, Donald Trump
did about as well in New Jersey as a
Republican has done. I remember watching
the results turn in. Um, he is a mega
star. He&#39;s from New York. Obviously has
some kind of connection with
workingclass voters that no other
Republican has been able uh to recreate.
Why would you do better in New Jersey
than Donald Trump will?
because this race is all about New
Jersey. And we keep talking about the
failed policies of the current
administration. It has been a failure on
taxes, on spending, on public safety, on
public education, on housing. It&#39;s been
a failure across the board. And my
opponent&#39;s not from New Jersey. And uh
if you watch their two debate
performances, it&#39;s really quite clear no
candidate for governor has ever been
more ill-prepared or unqualified for the
job. This race is all about New Jersey.
My opponent wants to talk all about the
president, her disdain for the
president, that she could fly a
helicopter and constantly lie about me,
but it&#39;s falling on deaf ears. That&#39;s
none of that&#39;s going to fix New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; Fair enough. And she has definitely
tried to make it about Donald Trump. Uh
sir, good to have you. Uh a refreshing
uh set of answers from somebody who
answers the question and doesn&#39;t
filibuster. We appreciate you being
