the the polls are tightening and I&#39;ve
been very encouraged by the latest
polls, but how do you get it over the
finish line?
&gt;&gt; First of all, Megan, the polls that we
trust, including Emerson this morning,
have it as a literally a dead heat.
There&#39;s a couple that have me up by a
point or two. Listen, people across the
state are ticked off after eight years
of failed policies of the current
administration, all of which have been
endorsed by my opponent. She&#39;s not from
New Jersey. She hasn&#39;t been able to
answer the most basic questions. And as
you mentioned at the very beginning,
there&#39;s been a number of scandals that
call into question her character. We&#39;re
just going to continue to get out there
and don&#39;t forget the majority party in
New Jersey are the 2.5 million
unaffiliated independent voters that
lean right and this time they favor
Chedarelli.
&gt;&gt; Can they what if they haven&#39;t
registered? Is there any way to still
register to vote in New Jersey before
Tuesday or No,
&gt;&gt; we don&#39;t have same day registration here
in New Jersey and that&#39;s not something I
support. What I do support is voter ID
and that&#39;s something I&#39;ll champion once
we win. Well, if you are registered, get
up off of your couch. Get up. Get up. We
can actually get a Republican running
the state and restore order or some sort
of decency to New Jersey. I want to show
one thing that is personal to yours
truly because I do spend every summer in
New Jersey. I&#39;m a homeowner there. This
is small ball, but I think everybody
watching this will understand our
frustration. This is from a report that
aired on Fox News. Uh Fox News&#39;s Brian
Yennis. Uh I don&#39;t know how to pronounce
his last name. Forgive me. Yeah.
Reporting today. Watch this.
Now, Chidarelli also says he&#39;s been
surprised by how fired up voters are
over a sleeper issue potentially in this
campaign. His plan to get rid of the
state&#39;s plastic bag and single-use paper
bag ban.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Come out of the store with a bunch of
items and you got to purchase a new bag.
It&#39;s really ridiculous.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s so silly.
My car is filled with all those other
kind of bags and they they&#39;re not
biodegradable. It&#39;s definitely a
struggle when you need to find a plastic
bag. They don&#39;t exist anymore. But it I
think that&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s not a
bad thing.
&gt;&gt; They are not single-use bags. I use them
all the time for all sorts of stuff. And
I recycle when they are finished. So
what is the problem?
&gt;&gt; We need plastic bags back.
&gt;&gt; We do.
&gt;&gt; We spoke to voters all over New Jersey.
Harris, it is a hot topic people love to
talk about. Chidarelli says it&#39;s his
number one applause line, it seems like,
at his rallies. Uh Cheryl says she wants
to keep the ban. So we&#39;ll see.
This could win you New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; It could. So, she&#39;s doubled down on the
Green New Deal that the current
governor&#39;s put in place that has two
things that people can&#39;t stand. The
first is the plastic bag ban. We&#39;re
getting rid of that. And the second
thing is wind farms off the Jersey
Shore. If the current government and my
opponent were from New Jersey, they&#39;d
know that the Jersey Shore is sank or
sank and we&#39;re not going to have wind
farms off our Jersey Shore. We will
lower the cost electricity by pulling
out a Reggie, but we&#39;re not going to
have wind farms off the Jersey Shore
when I&#39;m governor.
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s bad enough when you go to the
grocery store and you have to buy all
those new allegedly recyclable bags like
that you bought the last time, but you
forgot to bring them in with you. But
let me let me say this. Try going to Bed
Bath and Beyond or one of those stores
where you have to get like big things
and a lot of them, you know, like dish
towels or bath mats, whatever, like I
had to do this past summer. And they
won&#39;t give you a bag. It&#39;s like either
they let you take the cart directly to
your car or not, but then when you get
home, you need a bag. It&#39;s like, what&#39;s
so wrong with plastic bags? I love that
you&#39;ve made this an issue. Now, talk to
me about your opponent&#39;s military
history because she&#39;s not even been
consistent on the story. And I have to
say, I smell a rat in her story about
why she didn&#39;t walk in her graduation
from the Naval Academy. Megan, she&#39;s
changed her story three times, which
strongly suggests she&#39;s not telling the
truth. But listen, she could very easily
come clean by approving the release of
her disciplinary records. Only she can
do that if what she&#39;s telling us the
truth is the truth. The disciplinary
records will confirm that. But there&#39;s a
pattern here, Megan. She wasn&#39;t allowed
to walk at her naval graduation at the
Naval Academy. And by the way, she&#39;s
built her entire political brand about
her attendance at the Naval Academy, but
now we know that she was severely
punished. Um, she violated federal law
while in the Congress when it came to
stock trades and stock reporting. And
she tripled her net worth in only six
years time in the Congress, but can&#39;t
explain how. I mean, come on. Who
wouldn&#39;t know if they made $7 million?
&gt;&gt; Yes, she does seem a little befuddled on
whether she made money or how. Do we
have that with the Charlemagne exchange
is one of our I&#39;m trying to look.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. S 31. Let&#39;s listen. So, when
Newsmax claims that you made $7 million
from stock trades, what are they talking
about?
&gt;&gt; Newsmax is first of all a very
questionable organization that is um
paying multiple fines. I&#39;m not sure what
they&#39;re talking about.
&gt;&gt; Well, did you make seven million in
stock trades at all?
&gt;&gt; I I haven&#39;t I I don&#39;t believe I did, but
I&#39;d have to go see what what that was
alluding to again, what kind of came
from. It was a report in the
&gt;&gt; No, I know it was from Newsmax, which
again I
&gt;&gt; then another one in the Washington Free
Beacon, which is a conservativeleaning
platform, but they said you had increase
from between 733,
2020 to over 4 million in 2019 and then
between 4 million to 13 million in 2024.
So that&#39;s where they got the 7 million
increase. The average of the two broad a
Yeah. Yeah. Uh, look, I I um both my
husband and I come from very middle-ass
families. My parents were the first in
their
&gt;&gt; family to go to college and his were
both teachers and then we both went into
the military and afterwards he got a
good job and I we&#39;ve been really lucky.
&gt;&gt; Okay. She&#39;s much happier playing the
destitution derby card, but she&#39;s a
multi-millionaire who won&#39;t own up to
exactly how or when she got the funds.
Exactly. And she should know something
about paying fines. She had to pay them
for breaking federal law. It&#39;s
embarrassing and it&#39;s a disqualifier.
She&#39;s been going all around saying
she&#39;ll be the most transparent candidate
and governor ever, but yet she&#39;s not
transparent about her own personal
situation that has been legitimately
called into question. And by the way,
Megan, the New York Times reports that
while she&#39;s sitting on the House Armed
Services Committee, she&#39;s trading
defense stocks. I mean, are you kidding
me?
&gt;&gt; It&#39;s so unethical. The um issue of boys
playing in girls sports is another clear
dividing line between you and this Mikey
Cheryl. She she favors it. She wants to
allow this to keep happening.
&gt;&gt; This mother of two daughters voted yes
twice to allow biological boys to
participate in girls sports. That&#39;s an
8020 issue. And I just find this so
hypocritical because you and I both know
the Democrats will always talk about
their defense of women. Well, you&#39;re
undermining Title N by allowing
biological boys to participate in girls
sports. But this is somebody that also
supports one of Phil Murphy&#39;s policies,
our current governor, where school
districts keep secrets from parents,
which I think is immoral, indecent,
wrong, and dangerous. If we really care
about kids, stop allowing biological
boys and girls sports. And we&#39;re getting
rid of policy 5756. No more keeping
secrets from parents when I&#39;m governor.
Before you came on, we were talking
about how Colorado and New Jersey, New
Jersey are now the only two states in
the union, thanks to Phil Murphy, um
that are allowing abortion on demand all
the way through the 40th week of
pregnancy. It&#39;s crazy. So, I have two
questions for you. Number one, what
would you do about that now law in New
Jersey if you became governor? And
number two, how do you get a state
that&#39;s crazy enough to actually pass
that? You know, they had to have state
lawmakers involved. Phil Murphy had to
sign off on it to vote for a Republican.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. First, let me say, Megan, that
back at 21 with that very close race
that I lost, you alluded to, you know, I
flipped eight seats in the state
legislature, and that was with wind in
my face. We got some serious wind in our
back this time, I could flip 13 seats.
And when we do that, we&#39;ll have
something we haven&#39;t had in 25 years, a
Republican majority in our state
legislature. But listen, I&#39;m going to
fight like hell to make sure there are
not late term abortions. taxpayer
dollars are not paying for abortions,
but most of all, parental notification.
Something else my opponent does not
support. I mean, in New Jersey, you
can&#39;t get your ears pierced under the
age of 18 without the permission of your
parents. And yet, a 15, 16, or 17 year
old woman is going to get a an abortion,
not have parents be notified. Another
one of those 8020 issues here in New
Jersey that I&#39;m going to fight like hell
for.
