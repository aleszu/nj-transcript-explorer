Hi, I&#39;m Ray Penny with New Jersey School
Board Association. I&#39;d like to uh
welcome We have a special uh two special
programs. Both gubernatorial candidates
have agreed to talk to the over 4,800
schoolboard members and charter school
trustees in New Jersey about their views
on education. So, this will be just
focused on education. I think you&#39;ll
really enjoy it. Uh and it gets you to
hear our members and administrators can
hear what the candidates feel on
education.
Hi, welcome to uh another edition of uh
Education Matters. Uh I&#39;m Ray Pine. I&#39;ll
be your host. We&#39;ve been interviewing
the gubernatorial candidates. For this
interview, I&#39;m very uh pleased that we
have uh Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl from
the 11th district. Welcome, Mikey. How
are you?
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m good. Thanks so much for having me.
&gt;&gt; All right. Uh so first of all, thank you
on behalf of the 4,800 school board
members and charter school trustees in
the state for them to hear your thoughts
on education. So we&#39;ll get right to it.
The first question, New Jersey is
continually ranked one of the best
education systems in the state. We&#39;re
usually number one or two no matter what
metrics you use. Um but you know, what
will you do to keep us there or maybe
even improve uh our rankings?
Yeah. So, there&#39;s a couple things. Um,
overall, making sure that every single
kid in the state has access to a great
public school education. I think that is
something that has not only lifted so
many people up, but also um really fuels
the most competitive workforce in the
nation, too. uh we have the most
high-end workforce and I have had
several companies who&#39;ve actually left
and come back because they could not
find as well educated of a workforce as
they do here in New Jersey. So, it&#39;s
critical not only for the success of our
students and our families that kids have
access to great education, but it&#39;s also
critical to our workforce. Um, and so I
think uh one of the places I&#39;d start is
with third grade reading. are actually
seeing some pretty bad results in many
parts of the state and those scores. Um,
kids who are not reading right now at
third grade level and that&#39;s a critical
inflection point for our students. If
you can&#39;t read at grade level at third
grade, then you have trouble going on in
your social studies, history courses,
um, science courses, etc. If you can&#39;t
read the homework. So, making sure each
kid has the resources they need um, so
that they can achieve further success.
and in doing so driving in stuff like
highintensity tutoring which is an ev
evidence-based particular type of
tutoring that helps when students have
uh have fallen off the track a little
bit. We know from COVID we&#39;re still
recovering with learning loss etc. And
making sure we don&#39;t um kind of you know
have students that have gone through
maybe a rough patch in their academics.
We don&#39;t want to just leave them behind.
We want to make sure that we are getting
the students the resources they need to
be successful. high-intensity tutoring
is such a great way to do that. And it
also provides maybe an on-ramp to
teaching uh for tutors who kind of come
in and realize how much they love it and
they can um get on the track to start
teaching our kids as well. Um, and then
I also want to make sure that we&#39;re
looking at some of the county-based
school systems to help address the
historic segregation of our our state,
but also some of our county based
schools, our occupational schools or our
STEM schools are some of the highest
performing schools in the state. So,
making sure we have those kind of nimble
um uh high schools that can really help
uh address the workforce of the future
as well as we see AI and stuff like
that.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ll get to AI in a minute. Um
um school funding is always an issue and
it&#39;s probably it is the biggest portion
of the state budget. Um we have a
funding uh system in place um that it&#39;s
fully funded. uh not every single
district is happy. What What are your
thoughts on school funding?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so this is the first time that
we&#39;ve actually fully funded the school
formula in this administration in in
years really. And I think um it&#39;s
important that we keep putting the
resources in there because we have seen
some slippage in our national results
and making sure that our schools have
the resources they need to perform well.
Um and deferring some of the cost of
running schools that each municipality
faces. that can be really helpful if the
funding formula has run well, but we
need to modernize and stabilize it. And
by that I mean um some of the formula
hasn&#39;t been updated in several years and
so looking at where students with
disabilities are living. Um now it&#39;s
sort of a one-sizefits-all, but really
addressing some more individualized
funding for those areas with higher than
average uh students with disabilities.
um areas that that have um some of the
higher cost in education, but also
stabilizing it because in too many cases
these funding changes come in near the
uh start of the school year and so
suddenly right before schools are
starting you see some cut to your
funding and all of a sudden you&#39;re
firing teachers or ending programs. So
in that way too we need to stabilize it
so there aren&#39;t wild swings
year-over-year.
&gt;&gt; Okay, I&#39;m shift gears a little bit. um
particularly since the pandemic social
emotional uh learning and also looking
at the mental health of our students has
become very important and some say it
leads to academic achievement. Is that
going to be a focus of your uh school
district as of your school district your
administration as well?
&gt;&gt; Um
definitely this is a key part of my is
going to be a key part of my
administration. It&#39;s certainly a key
part of what I&#39;m campaigning on because
I&#39;ll tell you as a mom of four kids, I
have four three teenagers and a
20-year-old. And so, as you can imagine,
um that age group has been hit
incredibly hard. Certainly, COVID
impacted them and and their
socialization, their social emotional
well-being. But then um even more
impactful right now is the online um the
online platforms that are such an
everyday part of their lives that can be
so incredibly damaging. So that&#39;s why as
governor I&#39;m going to pass the kids
online safety act, making sure we are
addressing age appropriate design code
and holding big tech accountable for the
mental harm that they are doing to so
many of our kids right now, but also
pushing in more mental health resources
into our schools to help our students
navigate this much better because it
it&#39;s really it&#39;s really sad. I&#39;ll just
tell you um in the past uh two weeks
alone I have heard um um of two uh
suicides of children um in that that we
know the families and stuff. So, it&#39;s
been that this is a this is a really
really tough issue and um hearing from
students at how
what a poor impact
the what goes on online has on their
mental health and how the um design code
and the algorithms move them into worse
and worse places online and and actually
any type of therapy or support system
they have in place is undermined by the
online activity. It&#39;s really um it&#39;s
really so sad to hear. So, as governor,
I&#39;m going to to address this and like I
said, starting with the kids online
safety act.
&gt;&gt; Well, I was going to get to this
question later, but I think I&#39;ll do it
now since it ties in directly what you
say. Schools are grappling with the cell
phones usage of students, uh how they
should use it in school, if they should
use it, should it be banned? Uh and also
AI is coming on as an educational tool,
but also that has, you know, there&#39;s a
lot of issues with that. Since you you
kind of touched on that, do you want to
eliberate elaborate on, you know, your
thoughts of AI and cell phones in
schools?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I&#39;ll be quick because I just
noticed the time and I have to hop off
in a few minutes, but um I&#39;ll let you,
you know, I&#39;d say, yeah, I&#39;m for a cell
phone ban in schools. Kids need a break.
They need to focus on their learning.
They need to focus on their social
emotional wellness. And I think taking
cell phones out of schools can really be
helpful to that.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do I have one? I have one more
question.
&gt;&gt; You have one more.
&gt;&gt; One more. Uh, diversity, equity, and
inclusion is uh something that is uh Did
I just lose? Okay, I thought I lost you.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion is
something that it&#39;s kind of a flash
point for some people. Uh, it&#39;s better
known as DEI. Some people feel it helps
all the students uh particularly those
that might uh be overlooked and some
people feel it kind of plays uh the
opposite. It plays favorites. So what
are your thoughts on DEI and the
schools? Um and how how do you look at
as an administration?
&gt;&gt; You know I think one of the strengths of
our state and one of the reasons we have
some of the most successful students in
the nation is because we have students
from all over the world. Um, it&#39;s
because we have students from all
different backgrounds and so it&#39;s
incredibly important to me to find
pathways to success for every student.
We, you know, I do it because I think
it&#39;s morally the right thing to do uh to
to help drive opportunity. I also do it
because I think it&#39;s the best uh
economic thing I can do for our state is
to provide this really strong workforce.
And part of that and part of the
understanding, we are not a state that
is isolated. We&#39;re not sort of a
backwater. We are a state that has power
in the world. Um, and so the idea that,
you know, the idea I think that that
helps our students most is to give them
a broad understanding of the world and a
broad understanding of our history and
our background. And in too many cases
right now, the Trump administration is
trying to whitewash that. So, for
example, you know, clearing Jackie
Robinson off the DoD websites or trying
to act as if um some of the Civil War uh
generals who attacked our nation, our
democracy, and our country uh should be
lifted up even though they committed
treachery. I I think is just um really
uh not what New Jerseyians want to see.
I think in New Jersey, we want to hear
about all the New Jerseyians that led to
our success from every background. And I
think that that diversity of thought is
really important and that&#39;s important to
me.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I&#39;d like to thank
Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl for joining
us for, you know, a few minutes here to
talk about her thoughts on education. Uh
I hope you all enjoyed uh hearing from
the congresswoman. Thank you. Well,
&gt;&gt; thank you so much for having me and hope
to see you soon. Thanks again.
