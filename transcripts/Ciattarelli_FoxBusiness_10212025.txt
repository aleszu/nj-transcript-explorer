Let&#39;s ask him right now. Gubanatorial
Republican candidate for New Jersey,
Jack Chitterelli. Welcome, sir. This
race is a nailbiter and this is your
third attempt, for those who don&#39;t know,
at running for governor. There&#39;s so many
issues to tackle in the state of New
Jersey. Taxes, the state economy, jobs,
but the high cost of electricity is
really what&#39;s become this critical
talking point. What is your plan to
bring those costs? I mean, New Jersey is
12th highest in the nation. to bring
that cost down
&gt;&gt; to do the opposite of what the current
governor has done, Liz, and something my
opponent has endorsed. Uh we got to
reopen the plants that he shut down.
I&#39;ll repurpose them and use them, use
natural gas to generate more
electricity. We&#39;ll expand our nuclear
footprint down in South Jersey. Uh we&#39;ll
build three or four new uh natural gas
fired electricity generation plants. But
first of all, on day one by executive
order, I pull out a Reggie. The regional
greenhouse gas initiative is a carbon
tax policy that has failed New Jersey.
Air is no cleaner. Electricity is only
more expensive and rateayer dollars go
in other states. We can save 300 to $500
million a year on day one for rateayers,
homeowners, tenants, and businesses by
pulling out a Reggie. The Democratic
governor of Pennsylvania is not in
Reggie. New Jersey shouldn&#39;t be either.
&gt;&gt; It sounds like you are are um basically
echoing what President Trump has said.
He does not like green energy projects.
But my question is, and we we&#39;ve covered
this extensively, the state of Texas,
50% of its energy demands are now being
fed by alternative energy and subgreen
energy. So why wouldn&#39;t you check all
the boxes, do all of the above? Because
there is such incredible demand right
now for you for electricity.
&gt;&gt; Uh Liz, I hope you&#39;re not going to do
what my opponent does by comparing us to
Texas. My goodness, it&#39;s 30 times the
size of New Jersey with sun that shines
12 months a year. Listen, we need a
rational transition to the future. I&#39;m
not writing off solar. I think all the
warehousing that&#39;s gone up is prime real
estate for solar arrays on the rooftops.
That&#39;s not a nimi issue. The warehouse
is already there. My DP will accelerate
solar on the rooftops of warehouses.
We&#39;ll take an allabove approach. But
make no mistake, in that all the above
approach, we&#39;re not going to have wind
farms off our Jersey shore.
Let me ask you this about the demand
side of it. Basically, if you look at
what is soaking up most of the demand,
much of what residents do, and I&#39;m a New
Jersey resident, hasn&#39;t really changed
that much. But the sprouting up of these
AI data centers, they are huge gulpers
of this and large-scale data centers,
the growth in electricity usage from
them, and that includes New Jersey, is a
major factor. I mean as experts estimate
data centers alone could account for
something like 70% of the projected
demand increase. Can you give me a sense
of how you sort of skate just on the
edge here of wanting to stimulate the AI
buildout because that&#39;s great for the
economy but also make sure that they
shoulder the cost of what they are
drinking.
Liz, the vast majority of data centers
that have been proposed from New Jersey
have been rejected because we don&#39;t have
the juice. And the reason we don&#39;t have
the juice is because Phil Murphy shut
down six different electricity
generation plants. Put a moratorium on
the currently existing natural gas fired
electricity generation plants. Didn&#39;t
expand solar in South Jersey. Didn&#39;t
accelerate he didn&#39;t expand nuclear
rather in South Jersey and didn&#39;t
accelerate solar. He bet it all on wind.
Fact of the matter is Pennsylvania is
kicking our butt when it comes to data
center development. That&#39;s an economic
development opportunity in terms of the
construction operations. So when Phil
Murphy took office, we were an
electricity exporter. Today we have to
import our electricity. That&#39;s why we&#39;ve
got a shortage. It&#39;s why people are
paying through the notes.
&gt;&gt; You received an endorsement from
President Trump and uh that is I&#39;m sure
from your perspective really good. But
it was just earlier this month that the
Trump administration froze federal
funding as part of the government
shutdown. Certainly that project, the
gateway tunnel, the Hudson Gateway
tunnel between New York and New Jersey.
This would have been billions of dollars
in federal spending, but it would
certainly have connected so much of New
Jersey and shaken out a lot of the
traffic that is there. How do you how do
you feel about that,
&gt;&gt; Liz? The Gateway project is managed by
the Gateway Commission. The Gateway
Commission is flushed with cash. The
government shutdown would have to
continue for another two months before
that project would come to a halt. I
believe the shutdown will be over by
then. I think the president is just
playing some real hard ball tactics with
the Democrats by saying he&#39;s going to
shut down the Gateway project. It&#39;s the
quintessential federal infrastructure
project. It&#39;s not being shut down. With
me as governor and my relationship with
the president, hell or high water, we&#39;ll
get the Gateway project done.
&gt;&gt; Good to hear. All right. Uh Jack
Chidarelli, it&#39;s great to have you on
the show. Thank you so much for joining
us.
