Jersey governor. Attacks and accusations
intensifying on both sides. While the
latest poll today shows Representative
Mikey Cheryl as the front runner, her
challenger Jack Chidarelli not too far
behind.
&gt;&gt; Representative Mikey Cheryl joins us now
with the latest news from her campaign.
Congresswoman, thank you so much for
joining us.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for having me. Less than three
weeks to go and can we start by saying
that this race has gotten so ugly and
personal that it risks turning voters
off when they say one of their top
concerns is the price of utility bills.
So, you&#39;ve run on wanting to lower the
prices. You&#39;re looking to replace a
two-term Democratic governor. What went
wrong under Governor Murphy with utility
prices?
&gt;&gt; Well, I think just about everyone kicked
the can down the road. That&#39;s a favorite
New Jersey pastime, unfortunately. and
we&#39;re coming to the breaking point. So
whether it&#39;s utility prices, housing,
healthcare, long-term uh issues have not
been addressed. And so here we have just
about everyone, whether it&#39;s the grid
operator, the utility companies, the
administration
um or the Bureau of Public Utilities,
nobody has addressed this appropriately.
And so at the end of the day when the
rate hikes came from the grid operator
which had totally mismanaged the grid
PJM that cost was dumped on rateayers.
So that&#39;s why I said look on day one I&#39;m
freezing rate hikes and forcing people
to the table. I&#39;ve already had an open
letter from the public utilities to say
they want to meet to discuss the rate
hikes so we can come up with how we
drive them down. And then there&#39;s other
uh money coming into the Bureau of
Public Utilities we can use to defay
that cost as we drive in massive amounts
of energy into our grid to defay the
cost over time.
&gt;&gt; All right, Congresswoman, your opponent
narrowly lost four years ago, and it now
appears New Jersey has really only
gotten more purple in recent years. How
do you appeal to independent voters in a
race this tight?
&gt;&gt; You know, I always run to appeal to all
the voters. I find those issues that, as
I say, are keeping people up at night.
um if you&#39;re a mom or a dad or if you&#39;re
trying to make it uh try to pay your
bills, what is that thing that&#39;s really
keeping you up that as governor I can do
something about? And what I hear as I
speak to thousands and thousands of New
Jerseyians is that it&#39;s cost. It&#39;s
utility cost, it&#39;s housing cost, it&#39;s
health care costs at every single level.
And so that&#39;s why I&#39;ve taken an
aggressive campaign to drive down cost.
You heard about the utility costs. I&#39;m
going to really beef up the business
action center, cutting through red tape
and permitting. Just next door, we&#39;ve
seen Josh Shapiro cut through small
business permitting times by 90%. That
saves people time. It saves them money.
It helps with the the lifeblood of our
economy. But at the same time, I&#39;m going
to, you know, hold this administration
accountable because the tariffs are
raising costs on everybody. Everything
from a cup of coffee in the morning to
the grocery store prices you pay. And
also the one big beautiful bill from a
state like New Jersey which pays $70
billion more in federal taxes than we
get returned. If the federal government
is not going to run programs in
education and healthcare, then they need
to return that money to the state so
that we can run those programs for
people.
&gt;&gt; You know, in the last debate, you gave
the president an Fgrade when asked how
he was doing so far. you know, how do
you do that and still appeal to people
who may have voted for President Trump
but are open to a Democratic governor?
&gt;&gt; Well, right now in New Jersey, even
people who voted for President Trump or
like President Trump are, I think,
giving him an Fgrade on the economy
&gt;&gt; because what I hear from from people
across the state and including a lot of
Republicans is this frustration with
costs going up at every turn. I hear a
lot of people, especially those
independent voters, saying, &quot;Look, I I
voted for him because I thought my costs
are going to go down.&quot; But at this point
with the tariffs and now freezing the
gateway tunnel funding, which is, you
know, that would be responsible for
about a 100,000 jobs in the area, about
200,000 New Jerseyians take that tunnel
into New York every day for jobs. You
know, it&#39;s just at at every turn really
hampering our economy, which as you
know, the Northeast is responsible for
about 20% of the nation&#39;s GDP. This is a
really cool area to invest in, and when
you take away those investments, you
really imperil the entire economy of the
United States of America.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman, the last debate got very
heated with you accusing your opponent
of profiting off the opioid crisis. Do
you still stand behind what you said?
Have you heard anything from Jack
Shidelli&#39;s camp about a potential
lawsuit?
&gt;&gt; My opponent 100% profited off the opioid
crisis. He did so by printing
misinformation from opioid companies
that opioids were safe. Uh he did it by
working in tandem with them to develop a
a platform so that people could get
access to opioids. In fact, this is as a
company that ended up paying over $4
billion in settlement fees for their
wrongdoing was rolling out yet another
opioid product working with Jack
Chidarelli to develop an app so more
people could gain access to that product
as people um for example where I worked
at the US attorney&#39;s office as a federal
press where we were working to end pill
mills and to hold doctors accountable.
Jack was trying to help opioid companies
subvert doctors to get more opioids out
to people. Um, so he definitely profited
from this to the tune of millions and
millions of dollars and the people he
was working for, the opioid companies
were making billions of dollars and yet
tens of thousands of New Jerseyians were
dying.
&gt;&gt; So, Congresswoman, have you heard
anything about his camp in a potential
lawsuit? We we know that you&#39;re doubling
down on the claims. Have you heard
anything? and now he&#39;s trying to walk it
back I think because uh it was quite
frankly it was a you know after he&#39;s
been a perennial candidate. So after
running on this his small business
credits for about three times now as a
governor&#39;s in a governor&#39;s race when I
called him out on that business you know
he immediately tried to shut the
conversation down by threatening a
lawsuit but he has yet to actually file
and now it sounds like he&#39;s going to try
to walk that back but we&#39;ll see.
&gt;&gt; All right. Very well. We&#39;re going to
have to leave it there. Congresswoman
Mikey Cheryl, we appreciate you joining
us.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
