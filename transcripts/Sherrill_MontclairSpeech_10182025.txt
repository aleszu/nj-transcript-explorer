Montlair, New Jersey own Mikey Cheryl.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
Wow.
This is amazing.
I got to tell you, there is no better
place to do a no kings rally than the
People&#39;s Republic of Montlair.
&gt;&gt; It is great to see everybody here. And
you know, as I go up and down the state
and we think about what this means, I
hear again and again and again,
I want to create opportunity
for my friends, for my family, for my
kids, for their kids. I want to make
sure we all have a shot because this
president is running a worldwide
extortion racket and putting billions of
dollars in his pocket.
Not here, not in New Jersey. Because I
got to tell you, at every step of the
way, I have seen this country create
opportunity.
I&#39;ve seen it on my mom&#39;s side of the
family. You know what? My grandpa&#39;s
family lost everything in the Great
Depression.
His dad lost his job. He lost his house.
They moved back to the farm. And yet
after the war, my grandpa got a good
union job.
&gt;&gt; And with that job, he was able to raise
his eight kids. And when he got sick, he
had benefits. He didn&#39;t put our family
back into poverty. But it didn&#39;t end
there because I saw it on my dad&#39;s side
of the family. He grew up poor in West
Virginia. By the time he was 13, both of
his parents had died. And yet he was
able to work hard and to put himself
through college and he didn&#39;t have debt
for decades.
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s right.
&gt;&gt; So he helped get my family into the
middle class. But it didn&#39;t end there
because I have seen it in my own life.
When I went to my dad, I said, &quot;You know
what?&quot; I was in the fifth grade. I said,
&quot;I want to be a Navy pilot. I want to go
to the Naval Academy.&quot; And you know what
my dad said? He said, &quot;Mikey, I don&#39;t
actually think the Naval Academy takes
women.&quot;
He said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if the Navy has
women pilots.&quot;
But I knew that in this country, we
create opportunity. We don&#39;t shut it
down.
&gt;&gt; And so I graduated in the first class of
women from the Naval Academy.
on ships and oil.
So even in my own life, I&#39;ve seen
opportunity. And I am telling you, and
by the way, look around. There are
thousands of people out here today. I am
telling you that every single person
here today has a story about how in this
country their family had access to
opportunity that they wouldn&#39;t have
found anywhere else in the world or how
they had opportunity that their mom or
their grandma never would have dreamed
of.
That&#39;s what we&#39;ve created. And it is so
iconic to this country that we know it
the world over as the American dream.
&gt;&gt; That is what I&#39;m fighting to preserve
here in New Jersey. That is why I&#39;m
running for governor.
And so I hear from people again and
again. If I&#39;m going to have access to
opportunity, if I&#39;m going to make it
here, you&#39;ve got to drive my cost down.
And so that&#39;s why on day one, I&#39;m
declaring a state of emergency on
utility costs. I&#39;m freezing rate hikes
on day one.
And I hear from people it&#39;s too
expensive housing
rent rental prices. So I am going after
people who are colluding to raise rental
prices. I am going to open up brands for
firsttime home buyers so you can create
opportunity. You can create generational
wealth for your families. I&#39;m going to
take on those PDMs, those middlemen,
because people are telling me, Mikey,
sometimes I can&#39;t pay for both my
prescription drugs and my family&#39;s
grocery bills. So, we&#39;re going to take
on PBM, the middlemen, raising
prescription drug costs so we can drive
them down. So, whether it&#39;s utility
costs, housing costs, healthcare costs,
we are going to drive down costs here in
New Jersey for families.
But it doesn&#39;t end at the border of New
Jersey because we know what&#39;s coming
from Washington.
We know at every level this president is
raising costs on people. So whether it&#39;s
that tariff regime where he&#39;s pocketing
billions while the people of New Jersey
pay higher cost on everything from the
cup of coffee in the morning to the
groceries
in the afternoon
at every level going up. Small
businesses going out of business, big
businesses not hiring.
Or whether it&#39;s that one big beautiful
bill. What is so beautiful?
&gt;&gt; What is so beautiful about not providing
food for hungry kids?
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s not who we are.
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s not New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; And then
saying he&#39;s going to terminate
the Gateway Tunnel project.
That could mean almost 100,000 jobs for
families. That&#39;s how we create
opportunity.
Not cutting that out. So at every turn,
we are facing a country where we in New
Jersey are trying to open up
opportunity. But we&#39;ve got a guy in
Washington DC that thinks he&#39;s going to
reap all of the benefits of being in
charge.
We&#39;re going to fight it.
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re going to fight it, stupid.
&gt;&gt; Mom.
&gt;&gt; So, I know the fact that you&#39;re here
today
means you have either voted
&gt;&gt; or you have a plan to vote. Am I right?
&gt;&gt; I thought so.
&gt;&gt; And look around. We got a lot of people
here.
But we got to get more people out to go.
&gt;&gt; So, I want each and every one of you to
think about five people.
&gt;&gt; Five people that you can check in with.
&gt;&gt; Make sure they got a plan to vote.
&gt;&gt; Make sure they have a ride to the polls
if they need it. Make sure they know
about early voting and where their
polling place is. Make sure they are
voting because together we are going to
prove something
&gt;&gt; because I want to tell you one final
thing.
New Jersey
&gt;&gt; is not a red state.
&gt;&gt; New Jersey
is not a purple state.
&gt;&gt; New Jersey is a blue state.
&gt;&gt; So when we vote, we win. When we vote,
we win.
&gt;&gt; When we vote,
Let&#39;s welcome. Thank you so much. I
really appreciate it.
&gt;&gt; Great seeing you guys.
&gt;&gt; Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey mighty Mikey
Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey.
When we vote, we win.
&gt;&gt; When we vote,
&gt;&gt; we win.
