Buckline Network Radio, America&#39;s
longest running Jewish broadcast
network, the voice of the Jewish
community.
&gt;&gt; Welcome to the podcast.
&gt;&gt; You are now tuned in to this episode of
our podcast. Today we are going to
interview some of the greatest and most
influential minds in our field. And now,
please welcome your host.
You&#39;re listening to Talk Line with Zev
Brener. America&#39;s premier Jewish
broadcast on the air since 1981.
&gt;&gt; And we&#39;re back. We&#39;re very pleased to
have Jack Ciderelli running for governor
of New York. Join New Jersey. New
Jersey, I should say, joining us here
again. I&#39;m so New York oriented. We have
a lot of listeners in New Jersey. So,
welcome back. And I got to say, come on.
I love you in the commercials where you
go, come on. Come on. Right. Is that a
come on? That&#39;s great. Well, listen,
that&#39;s a Jersey colloquialism, but come
on. Based on things she&#39;s doing, come
on. But Zeb, the great thing about
always coming on your show is the
introduction when you say some of the
greatest and most influential minds. No
one ever says that to me.
&gt;&gt; Well, now we say it about you. Listen,
it&#39;s let me tell you, it&#39;s not easy
running for office. People don&#39;t
understand what it takes. It takes being
on the campaign trail. You&#39;re everywhere
from what I&#39;m hearing in New Jersey.
different so many different events,
Jewish events, regular events, and you
also got to raise money and you also got
to put things together. It&#39;s a lot of
work running for office.
&gt;&gt; Uh it is. But call me crazy. I enjoy
every minute of it. I love the grind. I
love the competitive aspect of it. I
love the challenge. Uh we&#39;ve raised more
money than any Republican ginatorial
candidate in history. In fact, we broke
our record of 2021. But I will tell you,
Zev, uh based on what you&#39;re hearing, I
can confirm it. The energy across the
state is electric. The reception in
minority communities has been
overwhelmingly positive. And when
Democratic mayors are endorsing the
Republican nominee, that tells you
something.
&gt;&gt; But what&#39;s going on? It&#39;s a very nasty
campaign. And I know they keep saying
they have a tape. You were saying I&#39;m
going to raise taxes, right? What&#39;s
Where&#39;s that all about?
&gt;&gt; Well, they doctorred a tape. We were
talking about what other states do. I
talked about Florida not having an
income tax. I talked about Pennsylvania
having a flat tax of 3%. Our highest our
highest one is 11. And um and then I
mentioned that I just come back from
Tennessee where there&#39;s no income tax
but a 10% sales tax on everything. I was
talking about Tennessee. Wasn&#39;t talking
about New Jersey. They doctor the tape
make it sound like I&#39;m going to raise
the sales tax New Jersey to 10%. It&#39;s a
blatant lie and they know it.
&gt;&gt; Is that kosher to do? Isn&#39;t there any
body that regulates
this kind of activity in the in
politics?
&gt;&gt; Zev you know this is not a pretty
business and when it&#39;s played by
indecent people get downright ugly. But
to your question, there&#39;s no rules,
there&#39;s no police, there&#39;s no jail. Um,
people can say whatever the hell they
want. Although, I will say this, she did
say something in the last debate that&#39;s
going to get her in court. It&#39;s a slam
dunk defamation suit, and I&#39;ll be filing
it.
&gt;&gt; And what did she say about you?
&gt;&gt; She accused me of killing 10,000 people,
including children, because of my
involvement supposedly in the opioid um
epidemic across the country. It&#39;s a
blatant lie. It&#39;s baseless. It&#39;s
reckless. And again, I&#39;ll be filing a
defamation suit
&gt;&gt; before the election or after the
election.
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re waiting for some technical
guidance from elect, which is the
governing body that regulates campaign
finance. It may have to wait until the
day after election, but it&#39;s coming.
&gt;&gt; Now, you have very good relation with
the Jewish community. You&#39;re running to
Lakewood and to Tene and then with all
these Jewish enclaves, but yet from what
I understand, the your opposition is
trying to paint you as an anti-semite.
&gt;&gt; Well, I&#39;ve got Rabbi on the team as a
part of the inner circle. I&#39;m the first
gubernatorial to do that. I also have a
Muslim on the team um as part of the
inner circle and um the Muslim has been
catching um a whole lot of push back in
his community from people that don&#39;t
like his support of me. And what he said
is that there&#39;s members in the Muslim
community who&#39;ve accused him of taking
bribes from Jews.
So that&#39;s how ugly it&#39;s gotten out
there. But my opponent took that and
spun it as though I employ anti-semites
uh on my team. So again, a very
desperate attempt by a very desperate
campaign on behalf of a very desperate
candidate. We&#39;re going to win. Zev,
&gt;&gt; it sounds like she&#39;s trying to get into
the Jewish. I think you have a very
solid base, especially among the
Orthodox Jewish community.
&gt;&gt; Uh we do. We do. But in this era of
social media, you want to make sure that
none of these lies take root. And so
we&#39;ve been talking with members of
Jewish community all across New Jersey,
explaining why the Muslim adviser on my
team said what he said. He&#39;s being
attacked by members of his own community
because of his support of me and they&#39;re
attacking him in a number of ways. One
of which is he must be taking bribes
from Jews. That&#39;s why he&#39;s supporting
Jed Chedarelli.
&gt;&gt; Well, I want to go to the other side of
the Hudson and talking about New York.
Of course, you know, it&#39;s an exciting
race. Mani is somebody who&#39;s courted the
anti-Semitic vote. I spoken to some
pollsters and pundits such as Hank
Shankov who says the Madani factor is
going to help you Jack Cerelli in New
Jersey. Zav, we are going to roll out
the welcome act for sure for individuals
who don&#39;t feel safe under Mandami&#39;s uh
mayoral ship and certainly businesses
whose taxes are going to be raised. So
yeah, we&#39;ll be rolling out the welcome
act. But let me be clear, uh we&#39;ve got
400,000 New Jerseyians that work in
Manhattan each day and um I don&#39;t stop
worrying about them just because they&#39;ve
left our borders. So I&#39;m going to do
everything I can to protect them because
this guy just does not belong in public
office.
&gt;&gt; So let me ask you this question. Should
you become governor, and the chances are
very good that you will, with God&#39;s
help, what about congestion pricing?
It&#39;s very unpopular. Can you do anything
about it?
&gt;&gt; Here&#39;s what I can do. Uh, first of all,
I thank the president for beating up on
the New York Democrats over that thing,
which I think is an egregious money grab
on the backs of New Jerseyians. And if
they go ahead with that plan, Zev,
they&#39;re forcing me to retaliate. Any New
York plate that comes through the
tunnels or over the bridge in the
morning into New Jersey, I&#39;m going to
hit them with a congestion pricing fee.
&gt;&gt; Uhoh. Will there were a trade war
between New York and New Jersey?
&gt;&gt; Well, listen, we&#39;re not going to be
pushed around. I mean, the 400,000 New
Jerseyians that work in Manhattan pay no
income tax to New Jersey. They pay
income tax to New York. They&#39;re buying a
bagel in the morning. They&#39;re buying
lunch. If they&#39;re working late, they&#39;re
buying dinner. They&#39;re a $2 billion
windfall for New York despite not using
government services. I mean, they pay
for their own commute. Maybe somebody
needs an ambulance from time to time,
but you get my point. It&#39;s a $2 billion
windfall. And now you&#39;re going to ask
those 400,000 people to pay for their
subway system. I don&#39;t think so.
&gt;&gt; But the people who will be coming to New
Jersey would be penalized because
they&#39;re those innocents in this
situation.
&gt;&gt; I hear you, Zeb, but I&#39;ve left with no
choice but to retaliate. And so doing,
hoping that New York reconsiders and
then I&#39;ll remove my congestion pricing
plan.
&gt;&gt; Well, okay. I wish they would
reconsider, but it might take a new
governor of New York to get that done.
It might, let&#39;s put it this way. If
Madani becomes mayor, there&#39;ll be a goo
will be a Republican governor in New
York. That&#39;s what they&#39;re saying.
&gt;&gt; Well, we we&#39;ll see. I mean, we&#39;re in it
to win it. But let me say this, Ev. I
don&#39;t know. If you&#39;re a New Yorker that
comes to New Jersey for time, I&#39;ll give
you a special plate. You won&#39;t have to
worry about the fee.
&gt;&gt; No, I&#39;m But don&#39;t worry about everybody
else, not just me. But
&gt;&gt; you&#39;re you&#39;re a man of the people, Sam.
You&#39;re a man of the people. Listen, but
but this race of course is is dealing
with issues and personalities and how
important factor where the Democrats are
bringing some big guns. I believe Obama
has been President Obama has been coming
in and others coming in to really
promote the Democratic. They&#39;re
concerned about New Jersey, right?
They&#39;re afraid that they may lose it.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And uh you know, one of the
members of the press recently asked me,
&quot;Who you bringing in?&quot; I said, &quot;I&#39;m
bringing in Jack Chedarelli. That&#39;s who
I&#39;m bringing in.&quot; I mean,
&gt;&gt; what about what about Donald Trump?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, at the end of the day, the
candidate has to win the race. I&#39;m doing
a telly town hall with the president
tonight. He&#39;s doing robocalls for us.
He&#39;s very busy. Um, you know, first he
took care of things in the Middle East
and we hope that peace plan comes
through. Now he&#39;s focusing on Ukraine.
He&#39;s bringing down the price of gas very
significantly. Uh, but he has been very,
very helpful. We welcome that. We had
Byron Donald&#39;s from Florida. He&#39;s a
congressperson who has declared for
governor there. And that was this week
and last week we had VC Ramaswami. But
at the end of the day, Zev, the
candidate&#39;s got to win the race.
&gt;&gt; Now, in the beginning of the race, the
focus was on tying you to Donald Trump.
Did that change? I noticed this the
tactics seem to have been. I know they
they slammed you as being MAGA and
voting for you as MAGA is as if the race
between Donald Trump and your opponent,
&gt;&gt; Ze, that hasn&#39;t changed. I mean, her
entire campaign, my opponent, is based
on a stack of lies about me and uh her
disdain for the president and that she
can fly a helicopter. None of which is
going to fix New Jersey. And so, you
know, Donald Trump&#39;s a lot more popular
in New Jersey these days than he was
when he first ran. I mean, his
improvement from 20 to 24 in the
presidential race in New Jersey. He
improved by over 10 points. That means
there&#39;s 300,000 people that feel
differently about the president today
than they did back in 2020. And when you
think about how close my race was in 21,
listen, I&#39;ll take those numbers.
&gt;&gt; Well, from what I&#39;ve heard there in New
Jersey, about at least two or 300,000
more registered Republicans than there
were four years ago. That should go in
your favor.
&gt;&gt; It really does. I mean, there&#39;s 100,000
fewer Democrats today and 200,000 more
Republicans. That&#39;s a 300,000 swing. So,
it puts us in excellent position, but
we&#39;re still the minority party. We can&#39;t
take anything for granted. And I don&#39;t.
So, I know the Jewish vote is pivotal in
this election. Between now and election
day, what are your plans reaching out to
more of the Jewish community?
&gt;&gt; I reach out to all minority communities
all across the state, no matter who they
are or where they are. But certainly the
the 600,000 Jews that call New Jersey
home can tip the scales in this race.
And last time I got 77% of the Jewish
vote. Uh I&#39;m expecting two things. A
larger turnout in the Jewish community
this time. Um they&#39;re very, very fearful
of all the anti-semitism. And I&#39;ve been
very clear on how we&#39;re going to fix
that. and they&#39;re really ticked off
about this whole Mandami thing and my
opponent has endorsed him and he&#39;s
endorsed her. So, uh I expect a larger
turnout and I expect that the um the um
the vote for Chedarelli be somewhere
around 90% if not better.
&gt;&gt; I agree with you. The Mandani factor can
be very very helpful to this race. But
you mentioned about fighting
anti-semitism. So what can be done in
New Jersey to combat anti-semitism and
hate?
&gt;&gt; Zev, we know that anti-semitism is up
around the globe. It&#39;s up around the
United States and sadly uh there are
more incidents of anti-semitism on a per
capita basis in New Jersey than any
other state.
&gt;&gt; I more in New York. I appoint the
attorney general. I appoint the 21
county prosecutors who report to the
attorney general. Local police chiefs in
New Jersey report to the county
prosecutors. And I also appoint the
superintendent of state police. And
those 23 appointments will be made with
people who are on the same page as me
with how it is we&#39;re going to fight
anti-semitism in the state. I&#39;ve
supported the IH definition of
anti-semitism. I want to put some teeth
behind it so there&#39;s legal consequences
for it. I&#39;m going to put the pressure on
our college universities and presidents
to make sure there&#39;s nothing going on on
our college campuses that threaten any
other member of the university
community. Um, and these are the things
that we could do. But I think first and
foremost, Zeb, we need a governor who&#39;s
going to call out anti-semitism when he
sees it and when he hears it. And I
won&#39;t be afraid to do that. I never
have. Now, in New York, the polls have
shown that 20 to 30% of the electorate
that voted for Mammdani are
anti-semmites. It used to be where you
had to be pro-semitic in order to run
for office. In New York, you have to be
an anti-semite to get at least some
traction. I&#39;m curious about Jersey. What
are the factors in Jersey and especially
with the Gaza war inflamed passions?
What factor is the anti-semitism factor
in New Jersey in this race? Listen, I
hear from a whole lot of people that um
that um Jew uh Israel is engaging in
genocide. Why are you supporting Israel?
What I&#39;ve said from the very beginning
is that and I continue to say that
Israel is a sovereign nation that has
every right to defend itself. It has an
obligation to protect its citizens and I
also believe it has an obligation to rid
the region of uh of terrorists and
that&#39;s exactly what it&#39;s doing. So uh
all Israel is a very very important ally
United States and what I&#39;ve said is as
governor New Jersey will stand in
solidarity with Israel particularly when
it comes to terrorism.
&gt;&gt; No it&#39;s important and also New Jersey
has a task force where they help and
promote economic cooperation with Israel
which I think is so important
&gt;&gt; and as governor I will create an
advisory council on Jewish relations uh
to m ensure that there&#39;s an ongoing
dialogue between the community and the
executive branch. I will reinvigorate
the governor&#39;s interfaith council which
brings together the leaders of all the
religious faiths all throughout New
Jersey and uh so we can talk about ways
to work together to strengthen our
community and I&#39;ve committed myself
every month to attending two different
houses of worship, synagogues, mosques,
temples, Christian churches on down the
line. It&#39;s another way to try to
celebrate our diversity here in New
Jersey but also bring us closer
together. We also get maybe coming on
once a month if you&#39;re governor to join
us on air at least.
&gt;&gt; I would love that. See, we love that.
&gt;&gt; We got to give equal time to Sid
Rosenberg, too. I guess,
&gt;&gt; right? Exactly.
&gt;&gt; What&#39;s your relationship with S? He&#39;s a
wonderful guy.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m sorry.
&gt;&gt; I said, what&#39;s your relationship with
Sid Roseber? I know he&#39;s a wonderful
guy. You&#39;re on pretty regularly on his
program, too.
&gt;&gt; Our relationship is solid. He has me on
often, as does John Katz Matitis and
Rita Crosby in the late afternoon. And
so, you know, listen, I believe in
radio. It&#39;s something, you know,
everything old is new again with the
with the speed at which our lives move
anymore in this internet era. Um, I
still believe in radio. People listen.
It&#39;s critically important and I
appreciate the air time.
&gt;&gt; By the way, the statistics bear you out.
People are so enamored about podcasts.
According to the stats, 50% of all
podcasts get 30 listeners, 30. Another
25% get 125. The rest get all those
crazy numbers that you hear about. The
majority of podcasts have barely a
minimum almost less than almost a little
bit more than a million of people
listening to it.
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; Terrific. Anyway, what&#39;s your biggest
challenge on the campaign trail?
&gt;&gt; Hey, turnout. So, you know, with 10 days
to go, uh, tomorrow is the first day of
early voting. Saturday, October 24th or
5th, whatever it is, but it&#39;s the first
day, nine days of early voting. It&#39;s
time to remind people, get out and vote.
I do remind people the Democrats have
controlled the legislature for 25 years.
They&#39;ve controlled the executive branch
for eight years. If you want change, you
got to make a change. I mean, can
anybody say they&#39;re really better off
eight years after Phil Murphy&#39;s failed
policies, all of which have been
endorsed by my opponent. So, let&#39;s have
a change here in New Jersey. That&#39;s what
this election is all about. Get out
there and vote.
&gt;&gt; How do we motivate people? Because a lot
of people are not going to vote.
Unfortunately,
&gt;&gt; a lot of people are not going to vote.
But at the same time, um, Zev, I never
remember a time when so many people
across the state are angry about the way
things are. I&#39;ll be 64 in a couple
months. I never remember life ever being
this challenging in New Jersey. We&#39;ve
got an affordability crisis because of
taxes, because of utility rates, because
of housing, because of child care,
because of insuranceances. We&#39;ve got a
public education crisis. We&#39;ve watered
down the public school curriculum. We&#39;re
graduating illiterate kids. We&#39;ve got a
public safety crisis because of the way
that we&#39;ve handcuffed our police. We&#39;ve
already talked about anti-semitism. and
we have an affordable housing shortage,
but yet an overdevelopment of our
suburbs because housing policy has
failed in this state. These are the
issues that have people really ticked
off. And when they&#39;re ticked off,
they&#39;re motivated. When they&#39;re
motivated, I think they&#39;re going to
vote.
&gt;&gt; Well, as we close, I always tell my
audience to take the high pledge. 18
pledge to reach out to 18 people and get
them to vote. I think everybody has to
motivate other people aside from
themselves only to vote on election.
&gt;&gt; Deb friends don&#39;t let friends not vote.
Particularly when so much is on the
line. You&#39;ll never hear me say it&#39;s the
most important election of our lifetime.
I think it&#39;s an older old and tired
remark, but I will say this. Um, and
every election is important for for e
for different reasons, but I really do
believe this time around the future of
our state hangs in the balance. And so
this election is critically important.
Let&#39;s make a change.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. And you may have a lot of
New Yorkers, should win New York, you
may have a whole ton of New Yorkers
moving to the Garden State.
&gt;&gt; Yep. So they&#39;ll vote for me in my
re-election.
