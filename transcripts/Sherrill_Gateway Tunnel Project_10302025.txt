Five days to go into election day. Both
candidates are on the trail practically
non-stop. This morning, Mikey Cheryl
with former transportation secretary
Pete Buddha Judge at the Westfield train
station on the Gateway Tunnel project
stalled under the Trump administration,
which she says is bad for New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s not who I&#39;m going to serve as
your governor. I&#39;m going to focus
I&#39;m going to focus on serving the people
of New Jersey. She didn&#39;t just urge us
to choose this project for funding. She
helped to make sure the funds were there
in the first place by working to get the
bipartisan infrastructure law passed.
&gt;&gt; Voters are casting their ballots big
time. Nearly 917,000
votes have been cast through mail and
early voting. Both candidates asking
supporters to keep that momentum going.
&gt;&gt; There are moderate Democrats that have
had it. and I&#39;ve got 13 prominent
currently elected Democratic leaders
around the state who&#39;ve endorsed my
candidacy.
&gt;&gt; Quinnipic University releasing its
latest and final poll on this race
before election day, saying out of the
top 11 issues that matter to voters,
taxes, ethics and government, and
healthcare lead the list in that order.
What we&#39;ve seen is the strongest car
that Chidarelli has is as a business
guy. He&#39;s considered probably more
capable of handling the huge property
tax issue that people have in New
Jersey. She less so, but she&#39;s highly
regarded on other issues as far as
leadership. Perhaps that&#39;s her military
background. And she&#39;s very, very, very
strong with women.
&gt;&gt; Polls say Chadelli is trending very well
in shore communities. His supporters

Lake Manor this evening in Spring Lake,
