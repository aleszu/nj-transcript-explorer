So, the bill went from uh normally about
$125 a month at the shore house uh to
more than $250. And a lot of that has to
do with the increase in electricity
rates. And so, what I&#39;ll do on day one
is pull us out of Reggie. The regional
greenhouse gas initiative is a carbon
tax policy. Uh half a billion dollars
could be saved each year by pulling out
a Reggie. The Democratic governor of
Pennsylvania is not in Reggie. Uh I
think it&#39;s been a failure. Air is no
cleaner. Electricity is only more
expensive. And rateayer dollars are
going to other states. Uh we&#39;re seven
and a half years into this policy
failure. I can pull this out on day one
by executive order and save rateayers,
homeowners, tenants, and businesses a
half a billion dollars a year in uh in
electricity charges.
Uh my daughter just bought a home four
weeks ago and um it wasn&#39;t easy. Uh
people are over bidding. uh the ask
price. Uh there&#39;s a shortage of housing
in New Jersey, particularly affordable
housing. What concerns me greatly is
what we&#39;ve seen the last 10 years is a
whole lot of housing go up, but they&#39;re
all rentals. I think we need to get back
to owning the unit and we can come up
with arrangements that make it a lease
to purchase so young people afford the
home. That&#39;s how you build equity in
this country. I just want to see us
build more affordable housing consistent
with smart growth strategies. That means
our major urban centers and our transit
hubs. I live in one. Somerville. It&#39;s
got a Raron Valley train line. It&#39;s got
a New Jersey transit bus line. It&#39;s got
jobs, a hospital, a county government, a
court system, one mile of main street
with mom and pop shops that all employ
anywhere from 5 to 10 people. Um, that&#39;s
where high density housing belongs, not
out in the middle of nowhere. And I
think the poster child for the failure
of the current housing policy is the
condemnation through eminent domain of a
175year-old family farm in Cranberry. To
have to condemn a farm to build more
highdensity housing in a community where
there&#39;s no mass transit, no
infrastructure, no jobs, only putting
more idling cars on the road makes no
sense.
Number one, we need a new school funding
formula. Uh I believe the current
formula is unfair and uh it&#39;s nefarious.
It&#39;s arbitrary. The state doesn&#39;t show
us how the calculations are made. We&#39;re
a more equitable distribution of state
aid to our districts. We can lower
property taxes in a great many districts
all around the state. I think that we
should make the first um I think that we
should freeze property taxes once you
hit age 70. Um we have a couple programs
out there to get you a rebate, but you
still have to pay the increase in
property taxes and then wait 18 months
for the rebate. Um, so I just want to
freeze property tax at age 870. I think
all property taxes for all New
Jerseyians should be 100% deductible on
their uh New Jersey tax return. And I
think we should make all retirement
income tax free that can help some of
our seniors uh afford their property
taxes. Uh so there&#39;s a number of things
that we can do to lower property taxes.
I&#39;m for New Jersey. And so, um, I
disagreed with the president on a number
of his positions back when when he
wanted to do offshore drilling. We don&#39;t
want that, New Jersey. He didn&#39;t support
the Gateway project. We are a donor
state. We want federal funding for that
important project and the like. This
time around, he&#39;s been pretty good to
New Jersey in a number of different
ways. temporary halt on the wind farms
beating up on New York Democrats over
their congestion pricing plan uh which I
oppose vehemently and certainly the big
beautiful bill which quadrupled the salt
deduction that&#39;s important in a state
that has the highest property taxes in
the nation.
Uh we&#39;re going to improve our curriculum
in two ways. We&#39;re getting back to
basics and teaching critical life skills
uh with an age appropriate curriculum
and providing more vocational training
opportunities because not all kids want
or need to go to college. And where a
child is behind grade level in the
critical life skills, we&#39;re going to
implement a high impact curriculum. Uh
we&#39;ve seen other states do this with
great success. We need to get our
children on grade level for things like
reading, writing, and math. The data is
pretty clear. If we do not, if they&#39;re
not on grade level by the end of 8th
grade, more than likely they&#39;ll be
underemployed their entire life.
Listen, my four children are vaccinated.
I would suggest that people get
vaccinated. We do have a medical
exemption in New Jersey. We have a
religious exemption in New Jersey. 16
other states have a philosophical
exemption, including those controlled by
Democratic legislatores legislators. Um,
I think the Democrats agree with the
current exemptions because they&#39;ve
controlled the Assembly, the Senate, and
the executive branch for the past eight
years and have done nothing to change
that. So, um, I think what people are
most concerned at is the volume of
vaccines that are given in a very, very
close period of time. And what I find a
lot of people are looking for is not
just informed consent, but the ability
to stretch out the vaccination schedule
if possible. A lot of parents are very
concerned with the volume of vaccines
given in a very short amount of time.
