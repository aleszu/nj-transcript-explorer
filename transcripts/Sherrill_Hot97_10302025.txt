in the morning with Laura Styles and
Rosenberg.
&gt;&gt; You shouldn&#39;t be saying that on the air.
&gt;&gt; Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl, the 11th
district of New Jersey and uh in hoping
to be the next governor of New Jersey.
Joining us right now on Ibra, Lauren
Rosenberg. Mikey, thanks for joining us.
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for having me.
&gt;&gt; Um first and foremost, how are you
feeling a week out from this thing? Do
do you feel how tight does it feel and
and and what do you have to do down this
home stretch to to beat Chidarelli?
&gt;&gt; Um it feels really good. We&#39;ve gotten
great vote by mail reports. We&#39;ve been
voting by mail for a couple weeks now.
Uh Saturday started early inerson voting
which is relatively new. So we were
really pleased that we won the day
because um I think my opponent was
suggesting he was gonna have some big
blow up but we certainly didn&#39;t see
that. So, we&#39;re just uh visiting um all
of the meet and greets, the churches,
the rallies, the having surrogates in.
We&#39;ve got Obama coming in next weekend.
So, um we are feeling really good.
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s pretty that&#39;s pretty cool.
Um
&gt;&gt; yeah, that that&#39;s really
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I&#39;m a little starruck.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Is that pressure? Is that pressure
though when you&#39;re when talking about
how important this is for the Democrats
that they&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, Barack is
coming out.&quot; Does that like feel like
personal pressure like, &quot;Oh man, we we
really got to win this thing.&quot;
&gt;&gt; Because, you know, I&#39;m going everywhere
and I&#39;m speaking and to rallies and
stuff, but the thought of um like giving
a speech in front of Obama feels very
intimidating. um quite frankly a little
I&#39;m super excited but then there is part
of me that&#39;s thinking huh that&#39;s going
to be really awkward.
&gt;&gt; Um how much how much is on the line
here? Um, like I think it&#39;s important
for our audience, um, because everyone
can get caught up on sort of, you know,
whatever the sexiest topic of the day
is, but like what is at stake with the
kind of candidate that Chitterelli is
and just how bad would it be for New
Jersey to go red in in this election?
&gt;&gt; I think it would be devastating. Um,
I&#39;ll tell you, I uh I think normally
having a Republican governor in New
Jersey h has been historically really
bad for our economy. So, the last
Republican we had um defunded Planned
Parenthood. The rate of STDs went up
throughout the state, for example. Um
rates of mammograms went down. We had um
the Gateway Tunnel, the Ark version of
it defunded. That&#39;s a tunnel, the Hudson
River tunnels that about 200,000 people
take a day from New Jersey. Um, often we
have summers of hell because of traffic
stoppage there in the rail tunnels. Um,
so our last Republican governor canceled
that. Um, we also ended up in huge
pension debt. Our credit rating went
down 11 times. So, in general,
Republicans are very bad economically
for the state. However, the combination
of a Republican governor with this
president who is wholescale destroying
the economy of the United States of
America running what I call a worldwide
extortion racket where everyone pays
more money for these tariffs and he and
his family pocket billions and billions
of dollars. to have that married with a
Republican governor who has said very
clearly he is going to execute the Trump
playbook here in New Jersey would just
be devastating in every single way. Um,
you know, we have so many programs that
we&#39;re running to try to lift people up,
whether it&#39;s education, opportunity,
jobs programs, health care programs to
get more people access to affordable
health care. All of that is at risk. Um,
we are seeing a huge defunding of it as
Trump somehow um raises the deficit by a
trillion dollars in only two months.
Somehow all the programs that lift
people up are being cancelled. So that
would be just a devastating blow to our
state.
&gt;&gt; I think one of the uh most viral moments
in Jack Chidarelli&#39;s campaign, I think
when asked about the black and Latino
vote, uh the importance to his campaign,
he was like, &quot;Next question.&quot; So to me,
that should tell you so so much. But can
you talk about um a little bit about
what your plan is, your agenda uh for
the Latino and black community
&gt;&gt; and why they should pay attention to you
and vote for you? Yeah. So, we um have
this desire here in New Jersey to create
opportunity for everyone to make sure
that everybody has a seat at the table.
And we haven&#39;t done a good enough job.
We like to say we have the best
education system in the nation, but it
still feels very much like it&#39;s by zip
code. And third grade reading scores,
for example, across the skate state in
all zip codes are not as good as they
need to be. So phonics-based education
making sure because you know I uh my
running mate Dr. Dale Caldwell says you
learn to read from birth until third
grade and then at third grade and for
the rest of your life you read to learn.
So it&#39;s a critical inflection point.
Kids online safety um is you know
something that I&#39;ve seen in my own
family with my own kids how devastating
it&#39;s been. mental health aspects of it
um are critical and I hear from the
black and Latino communities about
mental health issues, ensuring
opportunity, great education. We also
know here in the state that about 70% of
white families own their own homes and
only 30% of black families. So expanding
that firsttime home buyers program so
people can start to build generational
wealth. We&#39;ve had a state disparity
study showing that um black and Latino
communities aren&#39;t getting access to
state contracting at the rates they
should. And so implementing some of the
work that New York has done to create um
better opportunity here in the state
because in at every level
I am intent upon driving opportunity and
making sure that you can achieve the
American dream. You can build something
and then your kids can do better than
you are doing. And at every level we see
the Trump administration attacking that.
And it often feels to me like um we had
a saying in the military when you were
loading logistically it was last on
first off. And that&#39;s what opportunity
feels a little bit like. If you are kind
of more if you&#39;re a group of people or a
family that&#39;s more recently experienced
opportunity, it feels like you&#39;re the
first person then that gets harmed in an
economy that starts to go south like
Trump is doing. Um, and he is definitely
working to create an economy where if
you have made it, if you are wealthy
beyond measure, um, great, but everybody
else is going to be sort of scrambling
for scraps at that table. I want to
create the opposite in New Jersey.
Um now specifically uh um obviously
we&#39;re all like recoiling in terror as we
see what&#39;s happening with these ICE
raids in different parts of the country
and um I can&#39;t imagine if New Jersey for
example were to gain the eye of
President Trump and they were to decide
they decided to really go after New
Jersey in a hard way. If Jack Chedarelli
is governor there will be zero
resistance there. In fact it would be
the opposite. So, I I if you&#39;re elected
governor, what can you do to push back
against Trump&#39;s attack on undocumented
um immigrants and also just honestly
people of color and Latinos in general
because it seems now it&#39;s not just
undocumented people that are getting
stopped, detained, question, etc.
&gt;&gt; And and you know, so many of us who&#39;ve
served around the world could have
predicted in fact I said exactly this.
This is not just going to impact
undocumented people. It might start
there, but in countries I&#39;ve served in
around the world, it never ends there.
It it certainly expands quickly to what,
you know, an authoritarian government&#39;s
uh the leaders would call enemies of the
state. And we&#39;ve seen that. We&#39;ve even
seen him attacking, you know, just
basically telling all his US attorneys,
you know, just prosecute people. It
doesn&#39;t matter what the evidence says.
It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re guilty. And
we&#39;ve seen this from not just the
attacks on undocumented people, but
certainly then attacks on people who are
here legally and people who are citizens
and and we hear stories of people being
detained, parents not knowing where
their kids are as they just have been
out walking the dog. I have talked to
parents um who are telling their
children they have to carry the parents
are legal are citizens here, the
children are citizens here and they&#39;re
telling their kids you have to carry
your passport. Um that&#39;s like nothing
I&#39;ve ever seen in this country. So, as
governor, I&#39;m going to work to make sure
people are safe to go to school, to go
to their healthcare appointments, to go
report crimes. Um, that if there are
federal agents here, they are
identifiable. Um, I&#39;m on legislation in
Washington so that you have to be
identifiable. We had um and I&#39;ll carry
that out here in New Jersey. We had um a
police officer tell us that he came upon
somebody dressed like he was going to
Afghanistan in his town. So, imagine
you&#39;re walking down the street in your
neighborhood and there&#39;s somebody with a
mask on and camouflage carrying weapons.
So, the police officer goes up to him
and says, &quot;Uh, can you show me some ID?&quot;
And the guy says, &quot;I don&#39;t have to do
that.&quot; And the police officer says, &quot;And
I&#39;m going to have to take you in and
arrest you.&quot; And the guy goes, &quot;Well,
I&#39;m gonna arrest you.&quot; And the police
officer goes, &quot;Well, we&#39;ll fight it out
in jail, I guess, but you&#39;re going to
show me some identification.&quot; And
finally, he shows some identification
showing he&#39;s an ICE agent. But that&#39;s
unacceptable. To think that you can be
some sort of Rambo on the streets of
neighborhoods here in New Jersey is
unacceptable. So, as governor, um I&#39;m
going to make sure people are here are
identifier
identifiable following the law,
following the Constitution. But then we
also know that there is the threat of
National Guard troops on our streets and
that the president has tried to deploy
those, even going so far as to suggest
that he wants to use our cities as US
military training sites. I&#39;m a veteran.
That&#39;s appalling to me. It&#39;s appalling
to people who are serving who don&#39;t, you
know, would never want to do that. So,
um, we&#39;ve seen some good results in
California,
Oregon, Illinois. when that happens,
when those governors act very very
quickly to take uh to take cases to
court to have the AG prosecute those to
clear out um National Guard because it&#39;s
against the Insurrection Act. It&#39;s
against the Posiccomatus Act. They
should not be on the streets of our
towns.
Um, a a lot was made, Mikey, of uh the
you being pressed about money that you
made in the stock market while in
office, and I I think there seems to be
some confusion around it. Can you sort
of clear up where that stands? I a I
don&#39;t think people fully understand even
what the conversation is, but also it
certainly appears like one of those
things, and it&#39;s something that
Chitterelli has obviously jumped on. I
know we&#39;re airing um his commercials air
on our radio station and we and we hear
that segment. So, I just wanted to give
you the opportunity to sort of clear
that up for people who may not
understand exactly what that
conversation&#39;s about.
&gt;&gt; I know. And and I&#39;m frustrated because I
I don&#39;t think I understood the attack
when it was launched against me because
it&#39;s based on misinformation. Um I don&#39;t
trade individual stocks, so I nor does
my husband. So it it you know I put out
all of my financial information to the
dollar so that people can see because I
very much feel it&#39;s my responsibility to
show the people I want to serve um
transparency and accountability and I&#39;ll
continue to do that. I um I&#39;ve gone
above and beyond ethical requirements of
Congress. I&#39;m on legislation so that
other members of Congress don&#39;t trade in
individual stocks either and I will
certainly continue to be transparent and
accountable to the people as governor.
Um, another issue that obviously has
been huge, I I suppose it won&#39;t be as as
big for you being governor. Um, but it
seems like I mean, listen, it&#39;s a huge
issue in the mayor&#39;s race and that makes
no sense either. And that is, of course,
uh, Israel and Gaza. But currently, you
are in the house, so it is something
that affects you daytoday. Um, I know
that you&#39;ve been disturbed by what we
have seen happening in Gaza, uh, and the
the just death and and and starvation of
of children. And it does, this has been
a pivotal inflection point for how
people view the issue of Israel and
Gaza. And you know, and we talk about
this quite a bit on our show. As a
Jewish American, I&#39;ve been sort of
appalled at how this has happened and
just what a horrible job uh not only
Netanyahu has done with the war
specifically, but also ingratiating any
sort of goodwill around the world. Um,
what do you hope to see happen here as
we see this ceasefire that&#39;s sort of
hanging on by a thread? Um, number one,
what do you see unfolding here? And and
also, do you see a future in which
Israel can do anything to sort of make
things better both with how they
interact with Gaza and also how they are
viewed around the world from this point
moving forward because of how bad this
whole thing has been?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think they need to surge food
and medical aid and like yesterday. Um I
was, you know, I&#39;ve always been appalled
at hostage taking at the events of
October 7th. I I think that is something
that&#39;s widely agreed upon that um
&gt;&gt; of course,
&gt;&gt; you know, how that attack occurred was
awful. But that does not in any way
excuse uh using starvation as a tool of
war. And I have I&#39;ve said that from the
start. I&#39;ve been over to the Rafa border
crossing where food aid was not getting
in. I told Netanyahu specifically that
that was unacceptable. um and have
continued to press when we&#39;ve seen
certain food trucks uh there that were
going in to give food relief bond. Um
it&#39;s unacceptable to use starvation of
civilians as a tool of war and I
continue to feel very strongly that food
aid and medical aid needs to be surged
into Ga Gaza immediately. And I do think
that is something that um many Israelis
agree with and I think that would really
help Israel&#39;s reputation as we work to
get back to a place where we can
implement the Abraham Accords when we
can have Israel as part of the community
of nations supporting the economy there.
Um as well as pushing back against some
of the um Iranianbacked terrorism. But
again, none of that feels as if it can
move forward if you are actively
starving a population in Gaza. That&#39;s
unacceptable
&gt;&gt; because it&#39;s super important. And this
is something that we see every day. I
see a new article. Every day I see a new
headline about how women&#39;s reproductive
rights are under attack, right? Like I
just saw that the last Planned
Parenthood in Manhattan is going to
close like next month. So for you, for
the state of New Jersey and for the
people of New Jersey, what are some of
the things that you plan to do if
elected governor, like how can you
secure uh women&#39;s rights and and help
women have the care that they need?
&gt;&gt; You know, I I will tell you, I think
this is something that maybe some people
in New Jersey don&#39;t have on their radar
in a way that I I think people should
because my opponent wants to implement
an abortion ban. Oddly, he says he&#39;s
pro-choice, I think, to just kind of put
out more misinformation and muddy the
waters. But we&#39;re looking, you know, I&#39;m
I&#39;m looking across the country at states
that, you know, put in some of these
abortion bans and we&#39;re seeing women I I
talk about the story of a woman,
Porsche, down in Texas who had two
children at home, young children. She
went in having a miscarriage. Normally
before the fall of row that just would
have been what we would have called a
DNC but that&#39;s an abortion um as you&#39;re
having a miscarriage and yet they were
the doctors were afraid to give her a
DNC because um of the abortion been in
place and they were afraid of being
convicted and so they just kept giving
her blood transfusions as she&#39;s
hemorrhaging out on in a hospital. they
were fully, you know, capable of saving
her life, but the doctors didn&#39;t do so
and she bled out on the table in the
hospital. So, that&#39;s the threat I think
people don&#39;t realize here in New Jersey
because they think we&#39;re safe. But I&#39;ll
tell you, this is why I&#39;ve long been an
advocate for a constitutional amendment.
So, it doesn&#39;t matter who&#39;s governor,
but we know that Jack Chidarelli has
voted to defund Planned Parenthood. He
wants to put in place an abortion ban.
He&#39;s very close to the um the movement
to fully ban abortion here in New
Jersey. So um he has he has a pretty
clear record and I think would be a very
dangerous person to have an office here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don&#39;t think people really
understand how deep it goes and it&#39;s so
important for people to understand like
I&#39;ve read so many horrific stories of
women just dying or doctors telling them
you have to travel to another state to
get the care that you need which affects
people who are poor. Not everybody has
the finances, the time if you have
younger children to do that, to take off
a week to get the care that you need.
And it&#39;s completely unfair and it it
just will be catastrophic if it hits New
Jersey. It&#39;s been horrific in other
states. And it just will break my heart
to see so many women that will suffer,
so many families that will suffer. I am
convinced there&#39;s just no way
legislators can engage in this area.
Which is why I&#39;m so adamantly
just adamantly in favor of saying,
&quot;Look, this is between a woman and her
doctor.&quot; That is the the way you make
the best decisions to somehow try to
legislate.
You know, pregnancy is complicated. It&#39;s
it&#39;s funny because everybody does it to
have children, so you think, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s
just what people do.&quot; It&#39;s very
complicated and and I&#39;m sure you felt
the same way after you had your first
kid and heard all the for horror stories
of other women and what they went
through and what could have happened and
um and how scared you were. I remember
just being very scared. I almost didn&#39;t
want to read anything because I was you
know already worried enough about um my
pregnancy. So the thought that somehow
legislators, many of whom, you know,
have no idea, have no sense of
reproductive health whatsoever, could
make these choices for women. It just
keeps leading to women dying. That&#39;s
what it leads to.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And and and by the way, speaking of your
uh first child, you&#39;re you&#39;re obviously
a bonafide crazy person because you went
ahead and did this four times, which I
cannot fathom.
&gt;&gt; I am crazy.
&gt;&gt; Laura and I each have one. and hers is
five, mine is nine months. I don&#39;t know.
You have done a lot. You&#39;ve served in
the military. I don&#39;t know if anything
is harder than having four. What is the
age range of your of your kids, Mikey?
&gt;&gt; My oldest is 20 and my youngest is 13.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you kept you kept the window
at least relatively tight there. You
know, it hasn&#39;t been like an endless
&gt;&gt; Well, I always felt like if I got out of
diapers, I could never go back. So,
&gt;&gt; so it was always in diapers until it was
over.
&gt;&gt; We were out of it. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um well, listen, this is a a hugely
important election. I think that in this
area, you know, we have a tendency in
the Northeast and in the New York
metropolitan area specifically to sort
of be like, &quot;Hey, I know crazy stuff is
happening, but we&#39;re okay up here.&quot; um
New Jersey going for Chidarelli would
really do a lot to be the beginning of
the end potentially of that sort of uh
the sort of ideals that we believe in in
this part of the country. So, I hope
people have been able to take in this
conversation and we&#39;ll make the right
decision uh next week or right now if
they&#39;re early voting. Uh Mikey Cheryl
running for governor of New Jersey,
thank you for making time for us this
morning.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; And uh and good luck.
Thank you again and have a great day. I
really appreciate it.
