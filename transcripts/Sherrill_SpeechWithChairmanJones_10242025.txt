Oh my god, it is great to see all of you
tonight.
&gt;&gt; I feel like I am the most dedicated
member of the green team.
&gt;&gt; Keep it great.
&gt;&gt; You&#39;re not even on message. I&#39;m on
message. It is great to see you.
&gt;&gt; It is so great to see all of you. I am
so honored to be here. It is wonderful
to see such a great combination. Our
seniors, all you have fought for your
entire lives and now our young people.
So, you know why it&#39;s important that we
keep fighting
&gt;&gt; because there is so much at stake.
That&#39;s right. And I have to tell you,
you know, a lot of times I tell people
about my service in the military
&gt;&gt; and I tell them that
&gt;&gt; because our military is the most
accountable place on earth.
&gt;&gt; All right. We have people like these
young people, 17, 18 year olds fixing
helicopters.
&gt;&gt; I need to know if they sign the
maintenance law that they&#39;ve turned all
the bolts.
&gt;&gt; I need to know they&#39;re accountable. I
learned accountability in the military
and I&#39;m going to be accountable to all
of you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; There&#39;s another thing I learned. Servant
leadership.
&gt;&gt; To lead people is to serve people. to
take care of the people you&#39;re
&gt;&gt; to make sure if they&#39;re overseas and
their pay gets screwed up, I&#39;m fixing it
so their spouse can make rent. Or if
their kids sick, I&#39;m in the hospital
until we can get them back to the beach.
That&#39;s leadership. Taking care of
people. As governor, I&#39;m going to fight
hard to take care of all of these.
That&#39;s what I&#39;m
so there&#39;s accountability, there&#39;s
servant leadership, but there&#39;s
something else that&#39;s really critical
right now that this election is all
about. Opportunity. Uhhuh.
&gt;&gt; How many of you,
&gt;&gt; and I assume every single one,
&gt;&gt; had opportunities open to you that your
mom or your grandmother or grandfather
never would have thought possible?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Pretty amazing what you&#39;ve seen in your
lifetime.
&gt;&gt; And yet, how many of you thought we were
finished?
&gt;&gt; Not me.
We want these young people to have
better opportunities
&gt;&gt; than we have.
&gt;&gt; We want to keep up the fight. And that&#39;s
&gt;&gt; the path we all thought we were on.
&gt;&gt; So I was so proud because when I told my
dad I wanted to be a Navy helicopter
pilot. He told me he didn&#39;t think women
went to the Naval Academy and women he
didn&#39;t know if they flew in the Navy.
And yet by the time I graduated, women
were eligible for combat positions on
ships and aircraft. So I thought, &quot;Wow,
we&#39;re making progress.&quot; And I&#39;ve seen it
open up in my lifetime. One of my
classmates, a woman, was a commanding
officer of an aircraft carrier.
&gt;&gt; I never thought I&#39;d see the day.
&gt;&gt; I never thought I&#39;d see that.
&gt;&gt; And yet now we&#39;re seeing a roll back.
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re seeing all the women and black
admirals and generals fired.
&gt;&gt; We&#39;re seeing women lose their
reproductive rights.
We&#39;re seeing the president erase history
like Jackie Robinson
website Harriet Tubman
&gt;&gt; in our parks.
&gt;&gt; But I&#39;ve always thought of New Jersey as
a refuge.
&gt;&gt; I think of it as the gateway
to this country with a Statue of Liberty
&gt;&gt; right there welcoming people. We have
stops from the Underground Railroad.
people sought refuge.
You know, we just had Jim Klyber in.
&gt;&gt; He&#39;s a member of Congress from South
Carolina and he
&gt;&gt; Right. Right.
&gt;&gt; He&#39;s the reason Biden was the president.
He won South Carolina for Biden.
&gt;&gt; But he told me that when he grew up in
South Carolina, he couldn&#39;t get a good
job.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So, he spent summers here in New Jersey
in Patterson.
&gt;&gt; See,
&gt;&gt; because this is where he was able to
work.
So, I always have thought of New Jersey
as a refuge for people, as a place where
we were a little bit more on the leading
edge.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; of rights.
&gt;&gt; And I think today that&#39;s more apparent
than ever.
&gt;&gt; As we&#39;re working hard to open up
opportunity to everyone.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; As we&#39;re working to make sure that your
kids do just a little bit better,
&gt;&gt; my grandkids, my great
even better.
&gt;&gt; Three generations here. three
generations.
&gt;&gt; And I tell you, the president&#39;s doing
the opposite.
&gt;&gt; You know, he&#39;s got a worldwide extortion
racket where he&#39;s pocketing billions of
dollars and you&#39;re paying more for
everything.
