Newark. Newark. Newark.
&gt;&gt; Hello.
Hello.
Hi guys.
It is so wonderful to welcome President
Obama to the state
that I have always thought of as the
gateway to America.
New Jersey is like no other place in the
world. We are the most diverse, densely
populated state in the nation.
And despite that, or maybe because of
it, we care about each other and our
kids. We have each other&#39;s backs.
&gt;&gt; And from the earliest days, we have
never shied away from a tough fight.
&gt;&gt; We are waging a battle at this very
moment for the future of our nation. And
New Jersey has always answered the call
to defend this country and our values.
[Music]
&gt;&gt; We were the arsenal of democracy in
World War I. And then when soldiers came
home from World War II and demanded
more, we passed the nation&#39;s very first
state civil rights law in 1945.
[Applause]
And guess what? New Jersey.
&gt;&gt; It passed unanimously.
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; So we built this nation in the
industrial revolution and we have not
stopped innovating since. And at this
moment, in these difficult times, when
everything seems to come down to our
election, when people across the nation
look at me with fear and despair in
their eyes when they ask me, &quot;Is New
Jersey up for this moment?
You guys,
you guys just stole my line. My answer
was, &quot;Hell yeah.&quot;
&gt;&gt; I mean, there are a lot of things people
say about us. Do you guys know this? You
know, I go down to Washington. I&#39;m on
Capitol Hill with people from all over
the country and they say things like
we&#39;re loud.
&gt;&gt; My roommate down in in Congress gave me
a t-shirt. I love you back. I love you
back.
She gave me a t-shirt that said, &quot;I&#39;m
not yelling at you. I&#39;m from New
Jersey.&quot;
&gt;&gt; They say we don&#39;t have patience.
&gt;&gt; Okay, I&#39;m going to take that hit because
in this town, I have actually been
honked at at a red light because people
thought it was about to turn green.
[Applause]
They make fun of us because we don&#39;t
pump our own gas.
&gt;&gt; Guys, they hate us cuz they ain&#39;t us.
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; But I will tell you something. No one
has ever said that we aren&#39;t brave or
that we shrink from a challenge. And we
have never ever back down when it comes
to making a better future for our
families and our kids.
[Applause]
And I&#39;ve got four kids. And you know
what? Our kids have been through a lot.
We&#39;ve seen some of their milestones
robbed by the pandemic
&gt;&gt; and now they&#39;re facing an onslaught of
social media that can further isolate
them. So, I&#39;m going to pass the kids
online safety agenda because as Trump
tries to steal opportunity, success, and
a great future from our kids, all I can
say is not on my watch. New Jersey
[Applause]
So, as we arrive here today, just days
away from an election that will define
the very future of this great nation.
I&#39;ve been asked again and again, what is
this about? What does this race boil
down to?
&gt;&gt; Everything.
[Applause]
And after hearing from thousands and
thousands of New Jerseyians, I can tell
you it comes down to opportunity.
Who has a seat at the table? And in New
Jersey, we believe it doesn&#39;t matter who
your parents are. It doesn&#39;t matter
where you were born. You should get a
shot.
[Applause]
And so in this election, we are
deciding, do we continue to expand
access to opportunity? Do we make sure
every kid gets a good education?
[Applause]
That workers make a good wage.
That our economy provides good jobs.
Then you can work at one job and make a
living for your family and then retire.
&gt;&gt; New Jersey, I don&#39;t just want you to
have a job. I want you to have a
retirement.
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; And so what I hear about from families
all over this state reminds me of my own
background. My grandfather&#39;s family lost
everything in the Great Depression.
After the war, he got a good union job
with the UAW.
[Applause]
That job lifted my mom&#39;s family out of
poverty squarely into the middle middle
class. And then there was my dad,
orphaned by the time he was 13, but he
was able to work hard and put himself
through college and he wasn&#39;t saddled
with debt for 30 years.
&gt;&gt; And then me, you know, when I told my
dad, &quot;Hi, Dad.
Hi, Mom.
I love you, too, Mom.
When I told my dad in the fifth grade I
wanted to fly in the Navy like my
grandfather, he told me he didn&#39;t know
if the Naval Academy took women.
and he didn&#39;t know if women could fly in
the Navy.
&gt;&gt; But I knew I could do it.
&gt;&gt; I knew.
I didn&#39;t think I could. I didn&#39;t hope I
could. I knew I could because everything
I had learned about this country from my
parents to my teachers to Schoolhouse
Rock on Saturday morning cartoons
[Applause]
told me that in this country we were
opening up opportunity to everyone
&gt;&gt; and we were. We passed the Civil Rights
Act, the Voting Rights Act, decided Row
versus Wade, and so I attended the Naval
Academy, and I graduated with the first
class of women eligible for combat on
ships and aircraft.
And you heard from Dr. Dale Caldwell and
how his dad marched with Dr. Martin
Luther King and fought for civil rights
to give all of our kids better
opportunities.
You heard how his dad&#39;s example led Dale
to work in education to continue that
promise of opportunity and how hard he
works for his daughter. And at every
level,
in every generation, this country has
offered opportunities that could not
have been found anywhere else in the
world.
[Applause]
And I&#39;m looking out at thousands of you.
USA.
[Applause]
&gt;&gt; I am sure every single person here has a
similar story. Whether it was someone in
your family who got an opportunity or an
opportunity that wasn&#39;t available to
your parents but was to you. And that
promise of opportunity is so iconic that
it is known the world over as the
American dream.
[Applause]
And as President Obama himself said, the
American dream, that&#39;s right,
the American dream isn&#39;t the promise of
a perfect life, but at its best, it&#39;s
the promise that you get a real and
honest shot to get ahead.
So when people ask me, Mikey, why are
you running for governor? That&#39;s why I
want you to be able to afford to live in
New Jersey and build something.
I want I want all your kids to have
great opportunities. I want to make sure
everyone here has a shot in this state.
&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;m fighting I&#39;m fighting for Chuck,
a small business owner in Gloucester
getting crushed by tariffs. I&#39;m fighting
for Karina, a single mom here in Newark
who isn&#39;t sure if she can afford to stay
and raise her son in New Jersey. I&#39;m
fighting for Bob, a lot of us. I&#39;m
fighting for Bob, a veteran in Kate May
who&#39;s worried about his data privacy.
I&#39;m fighting for Regina in Trenton who
lost her son Trayvon to gun violence.
And I&#39;m fighting for Sequoia in Jersey
City who pays 70% of her income in rent
and can&#39;t get ahead.
That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to work every day
as your governor to make sure you can
afford to stay right here in New Jersey.
So, here&#39;s what I&#39;ll do. On day one, I&#39;m
declaring a state of emergency on
utility hikes.
I&#39;ll freeze those rate hikes to lower
your family&#39;s bills. New Jersey, I am
not playing.
&gt;&gt; I am not writing a strongly worded
letter. I am not starting up a working
group. I&#39;m not doing a 10-year study. I
am declaring a state of emergency.
&gt;&gt; But it&#39;s not just utility cost. I also
hear all across the state from New
Jerseyians who tell me they can&#39;t afford
to live and about anywhere to live and
about skyrocketing rental prices.
I&#39;m taking on those landlords who are
colluding to drive up your rents. And
I&#39;ll expand firsttime home buyer
assistance to get you in that first
home, get your foot in the door so you
can have a shot.
And I hear from too many families every
year. Mikey, you know, I&#39;m making
choices. How much can I buy at the
grocery store versus whether or not I
can afford my prescriptions? So, I&#39;m
taking on those pharmaceutical middlemen
who are driving up your prescription
drug cost.
So, as governor, I&#39;m going to create
real change so you can afford to stay
here in this state. But my fight doesn&#39;t
and can&#39;t end at the border of New
Jersey. We&#39;ve got to take on all those
hits coming from Trump and Washington
DC.
Because right now the president is
running a worldwide extortion racket.
[Applause]
[Music]
You pay more for everything from the
coffee you drink in the morning to the
groceries you&#39;re cooking dinner with at
night as Trump pockets billions.
His
energy plan is designed for just one
audience, the fossil fuel industry.
&gt;&gt; They donated hundreds of millions to his
campaign and they&#39;re now getting rich
off the higher utility prices that New
Jersey families are being forced to pay
because of the one big beautiful
betrayal.
Under Trump, the deficit has gone up$1
trillion dollars in two months.
And we can&#39;t feed hungry kids in the
richest nation on earth. We can&#39;t feed
hungry children.
&gt;&gt; Not on my watch.
[Applause]
So if he&#39;s not going to fund these
programs, and make no mistake, in New
Jersey, we send 70 billion dollar more
to Washington than we get back. We&#39;re
going to claw that money back and do it
ourselves.
[Applause]
And then there&#39;s the gateway tunnel. Has
anybody heard of that?
&gt;&gt; So, I was called the tunnel obsessed
congresswoman when I first got into
Congress because I worked so hard to get
that project funded. I was told it would
never get done, but we got that federal
funding and then we went farther and got
more funding across the state for our
transit programs. And Donald Trump
because he&#39;s pissed off that every
everybody&#39;s rightly blaming him for the
government shutdown has frozen the
gateway tunnel.
&gt;&gt; I mention all this because whether it&#39;s
Medicaid, the one big beautiful betrayal
or the gateway tunnel, guess what? Jack
Chidarelli is nowhere to be found.
And when he is forced to talk about it,
does he defend New Jersey? Does he does
he commit to climbing that money back
for New Jersey?
Does he say, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m serving you no
matter what the cost.&quot;
&gt;&gt; No. On every single occasion, Jack has
decided, &quot;I&#39;m going to defend Trump.&quot; He
even gives Trump an A.
&gt;&gt; Guess what, guys?
I give Trump an F.
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m committed to fighting anyone when it
comes to fighting for the people of New
Jersey.
[Applause]
So, there were two people who really
embodied this fight. Donald Payne Jr.
and Bill Pascal.
[Applause]
They passed away not too long ago. I
served with both of them. And at Bill&#39;s
funeral, the priest reminded us that
hope has two beautiful daughters. Anger
and courage.
Anger at the way things are and the
courage to fight for change.
[Applause]
And I&#39;m angry. I&#39;m angry at the way
things are. I&#39;m angry that our president
is cutting everything from the gateway
tunnel funds to SNAP benefits, erasing
funds for programs to help third graders
read, address learning loss, or get
support for families as we are facing a
mental health crisis with our kids.
&gt;&gt; So, I&#39;m angry, but I don&#39;t feel afraid.
As I stand here, I feel nothing but
courage. New Jerseyians give me courage.
And I&#39;m sure the nation feels that way,
too. Courage to make change, to take on
special interest, the status quo, the
systems that aren&#39;t working, to deliver
for people, for families, to give every
kid a shot. So
anger and courage are the daughters of
hope.
And I know someone here tonight who
knows a little bit about
[Applause]
he knows hope is not passive blind
optimism but an active stubborn belief
that a better future is possible if we
work hard and fight for it. So New
Jersey, are you ready to work?
Are you ready to fight hard for our
future?
Are you ready to make sure that every
single one of your neighbors, your
friends, your frenemies head to the
polls between now and Tuesday?
That&#39;s what I thought. Nope. That&#39;s what
I knew because I know the fight that
defines our state and New Jersey. I&#39;m
ready, too.
[Applause]
