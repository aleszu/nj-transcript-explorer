    "transcript_text": "August 13 - Sherrill speech Thank you so much. It is really wonderful to be here today. We're in really difficult times in this country and there aren't a lot of easy answers. I will tell you that when I look to Washington, I think a lot about what what I learned in the Navy. And I tell people all the time, the worst thing that you can do in the Navy is to run a ship ground. And yet every single time that happens, you find that there are people on the bridge of the ship that know it's going to run around and they don't say anything because they're scared because they're scared to stand up. And I tell that story because I see that all the time in Washington with so many people who know that the big beautiful bill is going to harm vulnerable people in this state who know that this tariff program is actually creating real economic harm and having people lose their jobs in this state who know that there is an attempt to defund Planned Parenthood through the big beautiful bill by using Medicaid cuts to do just that. again and again and again, undermining our state, undermining the people that I serve. And so, we're here today because there are too many people not getting engaged. So, I want to thank everybody here. And we have people here who probably agree with me on most of the things I'm working on. And we have people here, and you've heard from some of them, who don't. But that's what we're fighting so hard to preserve is for the ability for people to come out and speak their minds and the ability of people to register when they disagree. And that's why it's so important that you vote because votes are choices. And if we are going to create change here in New Jersey, if we're going to make sure that the experiment that we call democracy continues on for my children and your children and that that we can protect the rights and freedoms that we enjoy and that we can protect the opportunity in this state so that it does not matter who your parents were or who you know or how much money you can pay into somebody's campaign, But what matters is how hard you're willing to work. That is what we're all fighting for. And that's what I'm fighting to protect. So, thank you everyone for coming out today. Thank you for those people who felt passionately enough about an issue to come out and protest today because that's the very thing we're fighting to protect right now in this state. So, I really do appreciate your engagement and your involvement and I think it's critically important because right now I'm running against Jack Chidarelli. So, when you see in Washington DC every single Republican bending the knee to Donald Trump, now we are seeing it New Jersey. And so, I have fought on behalf of the people of New Jersey, whether it's a Republican or a Democrat. And as governor of New Jersey, no governor should bend the knee to the president of the United States when fighting for the people of this state, no matter who's in office. And yet, Jack Chidarelli has said he can't think of one thing he disagrees with Donald Trump on. He said if he was in office, he would have every single member of his delegation vote for that big, beautiful bill. That would harm New Jersey. That would harm our citizens. that would help people lose jobs. That would take away health care from hundreds of thousands of people. So that's why we're here today, to make sure we are registering people to vote, to make sure we are getting out the vote, to make sure that here in New Jersey, we create that different path forward that is so very contrary to what we see coming from Washington. So once again, thank you to everyone. I sincerely appreciate it. And thank you.",

    "transcript_text": "August 21, 2025 - Sherrill speech on energy Thank you so much. Um I really appreciate it and thanks for sharing your experiences. I'll get right to it. Our utility bills have gone up by 20% this summer. New Jerseyians are hurting and I hear it from families all across the state. You heard it from her, but he is just representative of so many of the families I speak to. And we can't continue to kick this can down the road. I was trained in the military. You handle a crisis head on. So on day one, I'm going to declare a state of emergency on utility costs. Um what that means for New Jerseyians and how to lower costs immediately is freezing utility rates on day one. When I take office, the average New Jersey family won't see an increase in utility rates for an entire year. I'll massively expand cheaper, cleaner power generation and building an energy arsenal in our state. We're going to cut through red tape and eliminate permitting delays to get that done right now. It means immediately breaking new ground on solar and battery storage projects, expanding capacity at our existing nuclear power plants, and streamlining the modernization of existing natural gas plants to make them cleaner and more efficient. I'll demand new a new level of transparency from our utility companies, JCPNL, PSCG, Atlantic City Electric, and Rockland Electric to prevent collusion and price gouging. and I'll instruct my attorney general to take on our grid operator PJM and Donald Trump to court to force them to end their mismanagement and get new power added to the grid. So, let me be clear. My plan is going to deliver immediate relief to New Jersey families by streamlining, modernizing, and expanding our energy arsenal. Will not only lower energy bills in the immediate future, but also create a long range plan and strategy for driving down cost, increasing production, and decreasing carbon emissions across the state because more power generation means lower bills. So, right now, solar is the fastest way we can get clean, cheap power into the grid, but we have too much red tape and permitting delay. So, we're worried that we're going to miss out on many of the programs that I passed in the last session of Congress. So, we have got to do better. We have got to get through the roadblocks, the interconnection delays that are preventing us from getting that into the grid. It's increasing utility bills. So, if we want to reduce utility costs, we need to get th those barriers and get that power into the grid. And my plan does exactly that. And we need to prepare for our future energy needs. So, I'm going to immediately develop plans for new nuclear capacity at Salem County. We already have a pre-approved site there, the fourth site. So, we have got to build that out. I'll sit down with neighboring states so that we can act together to drive down the cost of building new nuclear plants. It demands urgency because from across the state, I hear that this is breaking the back of too many families when we have an overall affordability crisis. So much of that pain is coming from electric bills. And the rate hikes are forcing families to make impossible choices between putting food on the table and paying for electric bills. I've heard from a hundred-year-old World War II veteran who's on a fixed income and in an assisted living facility. his bills have nearly tripled. So, it's what I've heard from Herb about having his electric electricity bills nearly double recently and having to re-evaluate his overall budget to adjust for that. It's unacceptable. The people of New Jersey can't afford any delay here. So, with immediate action, I'm going to get projects into the grid. I'm going to expand capacity, drive down price, and decrease carbon emissions. All of this is happening at the same time as Donald Trump is passing the price hike bill and driving up costs for everyone here. So, you know what? I'm a Democrat, sure, but I'm a New Jerseyian first. So, I am going to take on anyone who gets in the way of driving down costs for people. That includes PJM, a regional grid operator that has refused to plug new clean power into the grid, which is driving our utility bills up. My attorney general is going to join forces to take them on and add new energy to the gridge. I'll demand transparency from our utility companies like PSEG and JCPNL and Atlantic City Electric and Rockland Electric. When I'm governor, I'm going to make sure that they open their books so we can see exactly what is going on with pricing. I know I'm not going to back down as Donald Trump rolls back some of our clean power initiatives which have been working to enter enter more power into our grid and drive down prices. And this stands in complete contradiction to my opponent Jack Chidarelli because he won't take on anyone. He's going to do whatever Trump says. So he won't take on PJM. He won't take on the electric companies. He won't take on anyone if it if it threatens his relationship with Donald Trump. In fact, he's called PJM the largest grid operator in the United States the grid operator that a bipartisan group of governors across the country blames for much of this mismanagement, quote, some regional nonprofit and said that holding them accountable is quote a bunch of BS. He said it's okay if New Jerseyians feel some pain when it comes to Trump's economic policies that are punishing New Jerseyians. And here's some news for Jack. Trump's tax hike bill is raising utility costs by $220 each year. PJM's mismanagement is costing families an additional $400 per year. So yeah, people are feeling a lot of pain and as governor, I am going to address it. So we have an energy crisis on our hands. In times of crisis, I learned in the Navy you have to lead, follow, or get out of the way. I'm going to lead. Jack is going to follow whatever Trump tells him to do. Even if that means higher costs for New Jersey families. He's going to run away and let Jack call the shots. So, we have no time to waste and on day one, I'm going to get right to work. So, with that, I'm going to open it up to questions. Can you explain how the governor has the authority to freeze utility rates? Has the governor done before? So, no, this is something that we have looked into that I've determined as governor I'll have the power to do um to bring all of our um all of our utility companies to the table, BPU to the table, who's negotiating some of these prices um and make sure we're driving down cost. And there is also money that comes in through the BPU that I will use to defay some of this as well. Um but no, this is not something any governor's ever done before. Uh but if we are going to truly address the moment and meet the needs of New Jerseyians, we have got to act quickly to do so. And we've got to think of new ways of expanding state power to do just that. Talk about taking on PJM. If you're elected, will you explore taking New Jersey off of that grid opportunities? You know, I'm going to explore everything when it comes to building out our energy future and driving down cost immediately. And um I will start by working to drive down those immediate market costs. We've seen uh Governor Shapiro take them to court to set a Florida ceiling. We've seen um some production issues that Governor Moore has taken them to court on. But if they can't deliver, I mean recently they've had six years that it's taken to get projects into the grid. We have more projects in the queue in New Jersey than we actually have power in the grid. Many of those projects are clean power projects. So if they are going to continue to mismanage our grid like this, then yes, I'll explore all options to drive in capacity and drive down costs. If you're elected, you'll have to work hand in hand with New York and its new mayor. You haven't been clear about where you stand. Do you support mom Donnie? And if you don't, what are the reasons why? So, I have not weighed in on the New York governor's race because I'm running a race in New Jersey. I'm going to let the people of New York decide who their next mayor is going to be and then I'll deal with that person when they're in office. But what I'm critically focused on is how I'm going to govern New Jersey. And that means on day one declaring an energy utility cost emergency so we can drive down those costs right away so we can freeze rate hikes so we can hold people accountable who have mismanaged the grid, who have driven up prices and really deliver for families. Because right now, whether it comes to the administration, whether it comes to the utility companies, whether it comes to PJM, whether it comes to BPU, all of this mismanagement has been put on the backs of New Jersey families. And I'm not going to accept that. Applied, you know, I I was surprised when he uh won. And I I didn't really weigh in on that race beforehand or after. Congresswoman, what are the potentials to get wind and solar up to the degree that you would like with an administration that is so opposed, overtly opposed to wind and solar? So, we have got to increase our energy production here in New Jersey. And New Jersey has some really great opportunities in solar. Um we have quite a few warehouses. We're a logistics state and all those flat roofs provide great opportunities in solar. So what we have to do to drive that in is to um increase the use of solar but also increase battery storage capacity um so that we can drive it safely into our grid. Look at every turn we see the federal government and Donald Trump increasing costs for New Jerseyians. So whether it's the tariff policy, this energy policy which is driving up rates everywhere and will cost uh rate payers another couple hundred bucks a year um as we're seeing from the big beautiful bill, whether it is the $5 billion hit to the state government or whether it's cuts to the department of education or Medicaid again and again and again we see costs going up from the federal government. That's why I will both drive down costs here by cutting through permitting and red tape and getting solar into the grid as quickly as possible, but also taking this administration to court to claw back that federal money because remember New Jersey pays $70 billion more in federal taxes than we receive back. So the fact that this federal government is so incompetent and is costing us so much money is unacceptable. Congresswoman, some New Jersey Assembly Democrats have introduced legislation that would support the an operation of small modular nuclear reactors in the state. That's an idea that's opposed by some other legislative Democrats. You know, obviously if you become governor, they would have to redu reintroduce a bill, but where I'm interested in knowing where you stand on those small modular reactors. You know, I'm a supporter of small modular nukes. I I've actually worked side by side with them um for many years that the Navy has them on ships and has since the 60s. So, um, I think this is a a great opportunity going forward. Um, but we also have to look at where to site those. It's it's not as if you're going to put these in the middle of towns and stuff. So, I I do think there's a great conversation to be had, education to be done with the public, but I'm very supportive of that as one of the tools that we can use going forward. Congressman, um, how would you deploy your your BPU towards these efforts? Look, my PB my BPU is going to share my focus on expanding power, decreasing cost, and decreasing carbon emissions. And right now, I think again, this is just one of the entities that has really been asleep at the switch. This was a foreseeable crisis, not every single part of it, but the can was kicked down the road because it's complicated and hard to address. Well, look, that's that's no excuse for any entity that's serving the public. You know, this is what public servants do. So, my PPU is going to take these things head on and address these things head on. Are you looking to replace the current BPU commissioners? If the current BPU commissioners are not going to address this and if they are not going to drive down costs for people, then yes, they will be replaced. How much time are you going to give them to do that? Um, we are acting very quickly. Um, that's why this emergency will be declared on day one. We got time for one more. You mentioned Shapiro and more. What do you think specifically could have been done? As you know, this isn't a this is something you could have anticipated in the last 8 to 10 years here in New Jersey like what would you have specifically done differently that could have averted this crisis? So, I think it's I think it's several things. I think um it is making sure that as we are moving into new power such as solar that we're cutting through bureaucracy and red tape that is making it too hard. So, we have moved slowly. For example, in Pennsylvania, they've increased solar capacity by I think about 11%. We've actually lost some solar capacity over the last several years. And we have some of we have a lot of ability to do it. Um, but some of our utility companies aren't allowing some of the new solar projects onto the grid even at even in areas where they control the grid. Then more broadly, where PJM controls the grid, they've taken six years to get things onto the grid. This could have been handled and addressed years ago. We know um in Texas for example, I think they were taken about three years at the same time. So these types of things could have been addressed previously. Um I think we also should be generating more nuclear power. That fourth site was approved in I think 2016, but we've not made any moves to build that out, that fourth nuclear site. So that needs to be addressed. Um, so again and again and again in looking forward, we just haven't appropriately planned for the moment, which is why I'm both declaring the emergency so that families aren't bearing the brunt of lack of a plan for this moment by all the agencies, but also coming up with a long-term strategy so that we can address future power. All right. Thank you. Thank you. I'm glad we got you guys at 10. Is this ours? Great.",

    "transcript_text": "Mikie speech Aug 27 - Greater Atlantic City Chamber at the Seaview Golf Club in Galloway Township FULL CC And I've learned in the Navy that you can either lead, follow, or get out of the way. And right now, we are going to need strong leadership to navigate us through these difficult times. You know, it's interesting because I've told some of you this feels like the least partisan election I've read. And that's reminding me a little bit of the Navy where I never flew missions with Democrats or Republicans. We all understood that our mission was to serve the United States of America. And we were all able to work together to do just that. And I think that's what we need in New Jersey as we bring people together around our mission to better serve the people of New Jersey and to fight for a different future than a lot of what we see coming from Washington DC. But here at home, we're facing a number of huge economic challenges. In fact, our state is known as the 49th in the nation for business friendliness. For too long, leaders in Trenton haven't been responsive enough to the challenges facing business here in our state. And that's why I am going to make sure that we're prioritizing critical investments in Atlantic City and Atlantic County for key priorities like public transit, housing, and public safety. with you to solve these problems. So, here's my plan to make our state work for business. First, I'm going to streamline and simplify the new business licensing process and overhaul the state permitting process to reduce costs and delays that are holding the major projects back. So, this is going to involve making timelines available to all of you, making sure I am tracking those from the governor's office, and setting deadlines. We've seen in the state next door that Josh Shapiro has cut small business per permitting times by 90%. This is why we need to act quickly because several of our businesses has talked to me about how they're expanding in Pennsylvania and not here in New Jersey. So, I'm going to create a fasttrack team at the governor's office to expedite these approvals and make sure that they are your advocate in the permitting process. In other words, building a government that gets to yes, not works to get to no. I'll also dramatically cut how long these times take. Secondly, on taxes and fees. It's just too expensive to operate New Jersey and it makes it hard for businesses to compete. So, eliminate the new business registration fee to provide immediate tax relief. We don't want people hamstrung and opening up the very businesses that are the lifeblood of our communities, our economy, and how we employ people. I'll also develop new revenue sources that don't rely on new taxes. For example, I'll boost revenue for New Jersey Transit through transit oriented development so that we don't need to rely on the corporate transit fee. Third, skyrocketing energy costs are imposing a huge tax on our businesses. That's why I'll declare a state of emergency on utility costs on day one freezing rate hikes. I'll massively increase New Jersey's power generation by eliminating red tape and permitting delays to build an energy arsenal in our state because more power generation means lower bills. It also means immediately breaking ground on some of our solar projects and battery storage projects, expediting capacity upgrades at our nuclear plants and modernizing existing natural gas facilities to make them cleaner and more investments into Atlantic City and Atlantic County. Oxland bus rapid transit lines and service as well as microtransit options throughout the region to ensure that New Jersey transit isn't seen down here as North Jersey Transit. I'll ensure that Atlantic County receives its fair share of discretionary non-competitive grant funding for critical priorities like education, infrastructure, transit, housing, and public safety. I'll work hard to protect the thousands of good paying jobs that this city and county have relying on gaming and business convention industries. And I'll fight for fair representation on stateappointed bodies like the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority. Each of these challenges will not be easy to solve. But I promise you today that I will work with you and take on anyone that we need to take on to move this state and this county and this city forward. We all saw the national jobs report last month showing that tariff policies are paralyzing our economy. And in response to this news, what did Trump do? He fired the civil servants who collect the jobs data itself. That is not a solution-oriented government. My opponent has said he doesn't disagree with a single thing that Trump has done, including tariffs and turning our critical economic data into propaganda. I've spoken to small businesses from solar companies to HVAC installers and they're struggling. Trump has made it almost impossible to run some of these businesses and my opponent doesn't say a word.",

I'm your host, Michelle Globe, podcast publicist, author, and host of this show and read the damn book. Here you're going to learn from political candidates and from politicians. We're not just going to talk about the issues. We're going to talk about the human beings who are investing themselves in us so that we can invest ourselves in them. This is beyond the campaign. Hey friends, welcome back to another episode. I'm your host Michelle Glovak and hailing from the east coast, the great state of New Jersey. I have with me, Representative Mikey Cheryl, who is running for governor of New Jersey. When I started my deep dive into who is running for what office, I fell in love with her story. She's a Naval Academy grad, a helicopter pilot, a mom of four, an attorney, just an overall badass. That is what we call her in my house. I loved getting to hear her story, why she took these pivots along the way, and what issues she is most passionate about. I know these are all going to resonate with you. So, get ready for a great conversation with Representative Cheryl. Hello, Representative Cheryl. >> Hi. Thanks so much for having me today. >> Thank you so much for coming on. I am so excited to talk to you. And I do I have to preface it because it's so funny. I was telling my husband that I was interviewing you and I'm like, \"Yeah, Mikey Cheryl's coming on. She's running for governor.\" And she goes, \"He he's all she Aren't you interviewing a man?\" I'm like, \"No, it's Mikey.\" And I looked up what your real name is and I'm Michelle is your middle name. So, props to your parents. Was your call sign Mikey? >> Well, it was because um my name was Mikey. Then in helicopter squ in my helicopter squam they weren't as into call sign. So if you had a nickname like that you didn't really get a new call sign. So you were just um but the the reverse was kind of true. I remember interviewing for a job in the Navy and I was interviewing with some surface warfare people and I'm in the avi I was in the aviation community and I went and I said my name's Mikey Cheryl and they told me later I got the job but they told me later when I left they were making fun of me because they said I was introducing myself with my they thought I was introducing myself with my call sign like hey I'm Maverick you know that kind of like hey I'm Mikey and they were like okay Mikey and then I'm like that's my name they go well we know that now but it's so True. I I was in corporate aviation for almost 20 years and worked with a lot of former military pilots who all use their call sign. You're like, \"Come on, guys.\" >> Back in the day, you know, some of those things weren't that appropriate. So, it was always funny when people would just go by them. And I think you got to stop that right now. You got to start going by like Ste's. It would be better for everyone, >> right? I think even in my FBO days when I started, we had a supervisor who went by his call sign. I was like, \"Buddy, no. You're a line tech now.\" Yeah. Let's Let's tighten it up nowadays. Yeah. >> Before we dive too much deeper, can you introduce yourself to everyone, please? I'm Mikey Cheryl. I'm currently the congresswoman from the 11th district of New Jersey. That's northern New Jersey. And I am running for governor. I am the Democratic nominee for governor for the great state of New Jersey. >> I love that. I'm so excited. I I don't spend time in New Jersey because I'm all the way in California, but I've had Sander Booker on twice now. We got to meet in person. So, I feel like I'm pro New Jersey. >> Yeah, everybody has. Yeah. I feel like no matter where I go across the country, when I say, you know, I'm from New Jersey, everyone's like, Jersey. And I'm like, that's right. It's a good state to be from. >> I love this. And I love I love that. So, we've already talked a bit about your background, but you went to the Naval Academy. You're a helicopter pilot to in our house. That equates to you're a badass. Uh I I think that is so cool. I I always said that if I was going to get my pilot's license, it would be in helicopters because there's just something so much cooler about them and there's much more technique and anyone who's flown in a helicopter will get that. >> I totally agree with you. Um, and I like how in your house that equates to badass because I would like to implement that in my house. My teenagers aren't convinced yet, but I I'll work on it because I I like that attitude. >> I will send my nine-year-old to you. She She's not allowed to cuss, but she is allowed to use the word badass when referencing certain females. >> Oh, that's great. That's great. >> So, you you are the equivalent to a badass here, and she will say that. I will take it. >> Where did this love for aviation helicopters come from? And then the and you're an attorney. Um, so I feel like there's a lot of similarities here. My bachelors, my masters are in law because I thought I was going down that path, too, but I I kept veering. So, what was what was all of the inspiration for your journey in this career and then pivoting to politics, which we know is so fun? Yeah. So, I wanted to fly from an early age. Uh, my grandfather was a pilot in World War II. And I mean, that guy loved aviation, everything about it. He loved aircraft. He loved aircraft museums. Um, he just he would take every opportunity. My um uncle was in the Air Force and he would take him up some tent. I mean, just loved loved loved flying and and I sort of caught the bug early and I just remember he was in Cincinnati, Ohio, and we'd go to the Wright Pad Air Force Museum where they have a B24 and we'd go see it and we'd be seeing and he'd be talking about his days flying in World War II and what that was like and how that, you know, how that was and and all this stuff. I mean it the stories were always just amazing to me because here was a guy who you know had never really left Cincinnati as far as I know until he was a young man and then suddenly he's fing a B24 aircraft over to London meaning uh flying down the coast until I think Venezuela and then just kind of going east until he hit Africa and then going back up and I mean and then living in in London and getting shot down and being rescued rescued by the French. And it was just kind of an amazing amazing story to me and something I was always so fascinated by. And what came through again was how much he loved that kind of camaraderie he had in his squadron, how much he loved serving his country. And it was it was funny because he would take I have two younger sisters and he would take all of us to the right air force museum or to the Air and Space Museum in Washington. And my sisters would be like dragging along. Like, stop asking grandpa questions. We just want to go get lunch. Like, can we leave now? And I'd be like, stop. I just want to see one more. Blah blah blah. So, it was it it is I can see it in in my own family. I can see it um in my cousins and stuff. Sometimes you get bitten by the bug and sometimes you don't. But, uh I always wanted to fly. I always wanted to serve. >> And what made you choose the Naval Academy? Um, so my grandfather flew in the Army Air Corps, which was became the Air Force. And, um, so, uh, when I first told my dad I wanted to fly. And he said, you know, that's too expensive. You have to go in the military. I was like, yeah, I'm going to go to the Air Force. And he goes, \"Well, um, I I said, you know, but I want to go to college.\" He goes, \"Well, you should go to one of the surfacemies.\" I said, \"I'll go to the Air Force Academy.\" And he goes, \"Oh, you don't want to go.\" And and by the way, can I just preface this by saying I was like in the fifth grade. I don't think my father was real. This was not a deeply well thought out like we weren't sitting at a table with maps and and admissions pockets and and deciding my future. This was my dad largely doing something else as I was just hanging out with him saying, \"Yeah, okay. Well, you know, I want to go to the Air Force code.\" He's like, \"Ah, you don't want to go there.\" He goes, \"You want to go to one of the cool ones?\" Um he said uh the Air Force Academy is too new. He said the ones with real history are at West Point and the Naval Academy. And I said, 'Well, I want to fly. And and he wasn't in the military. He goes, \"Well, I think they fly in the Navy.\" Which I mean, by the way, they do. Like they have tons of air. Um that kind of shows you how well thought out this was. So he goes, \"I think they fly in the Navy.\" And I go, \"Okay, I'm going to go to the Naval Academy.\" And he said, \"Yeah, that's a really cool place. I went there as a boy scout when I was little and it was awesome. And I said, \"Okay, I'm going there.\" And um then uh I said, \"I'm gonna fly.\" And he said, \"Well, I don't know if the Naval Academy takes women and I don't know if the Navy has women pilots.\" And I just it to this day I remember that that was not at all an issue for me because everything I'd been told remember you know this was these were the days of you know Helen Ready and and you know I'm woman and I can you know do anything and and Gloria Steinum I mean there was just this real sense especially I think for young girls that you could do anything you know you can go achieve your goals and you can break down these barri barriers and don't pay attention if it's not available. And I I think that is everything that I remember feeling as a little girl feels now like it's under attack that those those same conversations going on now are so much more of, you know, parents thinking, \"Yeah, honey, I hope so.\" But and maybe not expressing that but thinking, you know, I know I think to myself, gosh, I got to fight for this because I have to make sure our kids I have to make sure all these kids in New Jersey have these opportunities and have that sense that this country can deliver. They've got to stay engaged. They've got to stay involved and I've got to provide that pathway. >> I completely agree as a mom of two. I'm a stepmom of two also. And you know, it it brings back those conversations where with the opposition saying, \"Well, I've always I've always respected where you lie in your political beliefs.\" And I go, \"Well, yeah, cuz I respect everybody, and I'm fighting for literally everybody, including your children and mine, and you are not.\" And that is exactly where we are in all of this, that the opposition is not fighting for the rights of our children. They're not fighting for us as women. and we have to do something. So, I love that you're coming forward for your state as a Californian. We're seeing that with Governor Nuomo and and he's standing up and I think that's why we are so lucky to live in California because we have someone who says don't poke the bear. >> We won't be poked. >> Right. Right. And and I just love, you know, I think um there's so little that can cut through what's going on now. And I think humor does it. I I think that's why you see the attack on like Stephen Cobear and stuff. I think humor does it really well. And I think um his current tirade on uh Twitter is just really enjoyable. >> It is. >> Really enjoyable. Yes. >> It breaks up the CNN breaking news alerts that are every morning. >> Exactly. Exactly. >> Yes. Or Aaron Parnass. I'm like please no more breaking news from you, buddy. Um, yes, we need those Twitter updates. >> Right. Right. Exactly. >> So, what made you decide to go into politics from being an attorney? I know you were focusing on criminal justice reform. Where did that change come to you and decide that no, I I want to run for an elected office? You know, it's funny because when you're doing something in your 20s, I don't think you realize until much later how much that just informs your outlook of the, you know, of the world and stuff and how that's kind of, you know, any experience that you have may be different from what other people are doing or thinking because you just sort of are like living your life. And I don't remember being incredibly focused on other people's lives. I remember kind of self-directed there, you know, in my 20s and I didn't have kids. I wasn't married. It was just kind of my life was about me. And um you suddenly get to a point in your life where you realize, huh, I'm kind of looking at this a little bit differently. And and the reason is because I'm so informed by some of those things that shaped me as a person. And and by that I mean the Naval Academy and the Navy. And I say that because I now live in Northern New Jersey, which isn't like living in Norfol, Virginia. There aren't, you know, it's I there aren't many veterans in my town. There aren't a lot of people in, you know, the high school that go off to serve in the military. And so I when when I got out of the Navy, I went to work. I went to law school. I went into a law firm. Again, not a lot of veterans. and just continued living my life. So, it almost came as a surprise to me to find how I still was so so many of those lessons were still so deeply ingrained in me. And um I say that because as I look back on why I did certain things, it just seems like some of that drive was came from some of the training in the military. So, in other words, I remember being in um a P training camp. We were trained if if you're in special forces or in naval aviation, you get trained in the event you find yourself behind enemy lines. So we did this training and there were commitments made meaning like the U US Navy the US military would not use any of these tactics um because we always want the moral high ground because you know but it would help us fight for your release because we would have the world community to fight with us because this is unacceptable. And so to see torture and rendition and Guantanamo and all of the things I was promised that the United States would never do, to see all of that being eroded, that is largely why I decided to go back to law school because I really felt like it was the Supreme Court at that time that was standing up and in a space where most people weren't. I really felt as if there was a need to fight for those values and to come at that in in a strong way to protect what those core values are of this country. I went on to serve. Um, and then, uh, I think it was some of what I was trained about in the Constitution and who we fought for and how we fought that led me to run the first time in 2018 for Congress because Donald Trump was attacking so much of what I'd spent my life fighting for, whether it was tor or whether it was, you know, against gold star families or against John McCain's service or any number of things. the Muslim ban. I mean, these things that I felt were deeply embedded in the Constitution of the United States that he was attacking and undermining and now um being at this moment where again there is a crisis at hand and what is the best way I can run to the fight? And I do remember in 2018 someone saying to me as I was running in 2018 and I was told like, \"Oh, you'll never win this race. You know, this the person you're running against is very entrenched. It's a Republican district. It's a Trump district. you can't do, you know, this can't this won't work out. And you know, so I'm running and I'm like, \"No, we can do this.\" And we're gathering the forces. And I remember somebody going, \"You've had friends. You're just everybody else is running away and you guys run right to the fight.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, I guess that's right. I mean, you're you're trained to do that.\" And and that's always been sort of what I focused on is where can I do the most good? Where can I address these things I'm really concerned about and make and affect the most change? And so that's what's compelled me in sort of all these career transitions is to find that space where I I'm really attracted to public service. I really like to feel that what I'm doing is making a difference. And um so that's always sort of driven me. And it came as a big surprise for me to one day sort of wake up and think, oh, I guess a lot of this is because that's kind of how I was trained in my very early formative years. >> I love that. And not to let's also mention you're a mom of four. So, you've been very busy career-wise, >> but you have four, they're not so tiny, but tiny humans, as I I call them, that you have been raising this entire time while creating huge change and running towards the fight, which is incredible, >> right? I mean, >> I think I think there are a lot of ways in which many of us feel as if We've had opportunities. I was able to serve in the Navy. I was I graduated in the first class of women eligible for combat on ships and aircraft. So, I was able to have this career in the Navy doing the thing I really wanted to do. Um I've been able to run for Congress and and I guess I I'll keep fighting because that's what I do, but it's really not me that I'm worried about. You know, I feel I can pay my bills right now. Um, I, you know, feel very much like I've achieved a lot of stuff I wanted to do. I, it's not my future that I'm concerned about. I'm concerned about my kids. I'm concerned about the kids in New Jersey. I'm concerned about any possible grandkids. I I don't think this country is in a place that is going to ensure that all of our kids have the greatest access to opportunity. Um, in fact, I think just by running for office, I maybe have put my family in more danger and that scares the heck out of me. So, I've got to create a world where that's not true, where I know that people can have a secure future. Where I know that at a minimum you can speak up against our government and you're not going to be put in jail. And that would have been really bizarre to say even five years ago that I was worried about that. But now I don't think anyone would question my concerns there. >> Not at all. I I tell my kids the same thing. I I say, \"Yes, you know that I'm interviewing politicians. If mommy gets arrested, we hope not.\" But you never know at this point. You never know. >> I I think that's exactly right. I think that's why having really strong states to protect people um because otherwise it doesn't feel like there are a lot of protections. should that come about to fight. I mean, when they have a member of the Senate handcuffed for speaking up at a press conference, something is really really wrong right now >> and dragged away. Yeah. We I mean, we watched it on TV, Sandra Padilla. And and you mentioned something that strikes me because as a mom and as a woman, you know, so often we ask that stupid question of, you know, how do you do this as a mom and you've got children? I make sure that if I ask that question of a female, I also ask it of a male. How are you doing it? What is your wife doing at home to help you? But you bring up such a different level. It's not simply how are you doing this and raising a family, but now you have to protect them on another level. What is that like? I I read Gretchen Whitmer's um memoir about how she had to keep her family safe and and this was years ago and it's only getting worse. Do you mind sharing a bit about what your concerns are or how you're protecting your family or how that's come up? I I don't want to get too personal, but that is a concern. >> Yeah, I I I'm you know, I maybe you could have sused this out from my background. I have a very high risk tolerance for myself. Like I am not risk averse in any way. I like traveling around the world. Um I've served all over the world and in you know sometimes countries without democracies and stuff like that. I um I've you know I've flown in naval aviation. We've had to do these all kinds of training that was um it felt fairly safe to me but it you know people died doing it on occasion and stuff. So, so I'm always fine with that stuff. I am the complete opposite when it comes to my kids. I mean, if I could just put them in bubble wrap and just say, you know, just sit right here next to me and I will always make sure you're safe and you know, that would be perfect. I hate the thought of them in any way being in danger. And I hate the thought more, 10 million times more, that it could be because of me, that because of something I'm doing that I'm I'm putting a bigger target on their head. That that just sickens me. And yet at the same time, it's balanced with this idea that if I don't do this, then they're going to be living half a life by not being able to say anything they want to say, not being able to be creative, not being able to write maybe the the stories they want to write or talk about the things they want to talk about or start a a podcast with things they want to talk about or people they want to talk to because none of that's going to be available if I don't fight back against what this administration is trying to create. And so it's a horrible, horrible decision to have to make in this time. Like, are you going to take the long view and fight hard for their future? Are you going to duck your head right now and just try to keep people safe today? And and I'm, you know, I've obviously picked my battle here, but it doesn't feel good. It doesn't feel like I know that for sure I've I've made the right choice. Um, and I I struggle with that. I mean, we see what happened in Minnesota. We have a judge here um where a person in her court came to her door and killed her only son. We just have a level of political violence going on right now that is um that is unacceptable and unusual and that is driving a lot of people out of this space. and and if we if we don't combat that, if we don't find ways to keep people safe and and find ways to support them in this, we're going to lose the things, I think, that are most important to our future. And and so, but it's horrible. It's a horrible, horrible thing that we even have to think of right now in these times. >> It's such a sacrifice that I think a lot of people don't recognize or realize. And because it's becoming so much more prevalent, we have to consider this and and to remember that this is what you are doing for all of us and to this is why I think it's so important to invest in you and hearing your story because of what you are doing and sacrificing for each and every one of us. Well, back at you. I mean, it horrible that you have to feel that level of anxiety and fear too for your kids. I mean that all the people engaging in trying to fight for this future have to think about that is just that's awful. But thank you. Thank you for doing what you're doing. It's I think all of I think all of us together these are all really incredibly important ways we push back and ways we get information out and ways we fight this. But yeah, it's unacceptable that that's where we are, which is what we're all fighting. If if there is one issue that you could say you are most passionate about fighting for, what would it be? And I know that there's so many issues to choose from, but is there just one that you are like this this is what I want to change? It's it's opportunity because I you know I had to do a deep dive after the last election because I have run you know talking about democracy and the constitution and the things I'm supportive of and that is very well defined in my mind. I grew up in the cold war. It was always very easy to define what a democratic state looks like because you always had the Soviet Union to show what a notdemocratic state looks like. So the lines were drawn. Um, but after this last election, I felt like it was a little too illdefined in the in the maybe in in the younger generation of of what exactly I meant by that. So, I started to take a deep dive like what does it mean? And and at its heart, I just totally think democracy and a well-run democracy is that opportunity piece, that idea that political philosophers have said about it. You know, you're trying to create a society where no matter who, you know, if you had no idea, if you were a little, you know, glint in your mom's eye or something, and you had no idea what race you were going to be born, what gender you were going to be born, you know, where, how much money your family was going to have, none of that. You had no idea. And you were just going to be dropped in to this body, if you will. Um, how what society would you create to give yourself the best chance? meaning, how do we give the best chance at opportunity to the most amount of people here? So again, it doesn't matter if you can give a million dollars to the president's campaign. It doesn't matter if you can buy a gazillion dollars of his cryptocurrency or his sneakers. It doesn't matter um who your parents know or how rich they are. Because right now, what I think at at its heart, what we're all what we're fighting for in the Democratic Party is largely that idea that I'm trying to create a world where your kids are going to have opportunity, that they're going to be able to do a little bit better than you're doing, where it doesn't matter who they know. And I'm so adamantly focused and passionate about this because I can trace a million different ways in which this has operated in my own family. And I tell people, you know, when I grew up, I didn't we didn't hang out with our congressmen or our senators. I didn't know our governor. You know, my family was just kind of a normal middle class family. Um, we didn't know anybody special. So, the idea that my, you know, my father and mother, they didn't serve. So, the idea that I was going to like do the things I've done, it wasn't because um I I certainly had advantages other people didn't have. and and you know starting from a really good place as a really secure middle-ass family. But it it wasn't as if it was predestined or you know I had some person that sort of omni omni you're going to get to do what you want and that was even more true of my dad who grew up poor in West Virginia or my mom who grew up in a union family you know her mom didn't work and and just kind of very modest means that I mean so again and again I've seen in my own family how this works and to think now that I just feel like we're creating this society where if you're rich, God bless, you're going to be fine and your kids are going to be fine and your grandkids and your great their kids and duh, and if you're not, you're going to be working three jobs and fighting for crumbs at the table and never get ahead. And I just I am so adamantly opposed to that. I just I think this country of all countries can do so much better than that by people. And that's what I'm fighting for. >> I completely agree. I love it. I I can't wait to celebrate you winning. >> I'm knocking on wood. I'm also a naval engineer, so I'm very superstitious. So, knocking on wood here. Yes, >> I do it all the time. >> Can you share with everyone where they can find you, donate to your campaign, learn more about you because, as I like to remind everyone, we don't have to be able to vote for you. We can still donate and help you out even from afar. >> Well, thank you so much. Thanks for asking. Um, it's at mikeysherald.com and you can find all the information there and every little bit helps. Um, my campaigns have already always been built on a lot of grassroots support, a lot of just, you know, $5 here from from a lot of people that just helps lift this campaign up. So, I really sincerely appreciate it and like I said, every every little bit helps. So, thank you. >> Thank you so much for sharing yourself and your story. I I thoroughly enjoyed getting to talk to you today. Well, likewise. I really do appreciate it and thanks again. Take care, stay safe, and hope to talk to you again soon.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 2 - Jack speech Irvington Now the moment has come to introduce the great candidate, the candidate who knows the importance of addressing the community, Jack. We want you more. Thank you all for being here tonight. These three great assembly candidates are the reason why we're going to flip the assembly this year and turn it Republican for the first time in 30 years. Guys, congratulations.  I heard someone saying we're comfortable tonight. Obviously, we're comfortable tonight. We're all New Jerseyians, aren't we? All New Jerseyians first and foremost. So, um it's great to be here tonight. And it's not my first time at Irvington. It won't be my last time at Irvington. I'll be back before November 4th. And I'll be back after we win on November 4th. Uh, one of the questions I get asked most often is why you run for governor. So 100 years ago, my grandparents came here from Italy. My grandfather started out in the ditch as a laborer for the water company and uh saved his nickels and dimes and worked his way up became a very successful independent contractor in the 20s, 30s and 40s at a time when it was not particularly easy for that type of immigrant to be that kind of successful. My parents were very very successful restaurant bar owners and I followed in my grandparents and parents footstep and I'm a two-time business owner here in the state after attending Seat Hall University in South Orange for six years where I got my bachelors in accounting and my masters in finance. And so when I'm asked why are you running for governor, it's really simple. I want today's New Jerseyians and future generations of New Jerseyians, no matter what their skin color, no matter what their race, creed or color, no matter what their zip code, to feel confident they can achieve their American dream right here in New Jersey. And so today, sadly, a great many people don't feel confident about achieving their American dream here in New Jersey. Whether it is the education of their dreams, the job of their dreams, raising a family here, starting a business here, retiring here, these are all the things that people feel insecure, if not fearful of today. And so I believe that we can fix that. I believe leadership matters. When something I love is broken, I want to fix it. And things are broken here in New Jersey, particularly in some of our urban centers where we don't see the two things that I think all Americans want foremost, opportunity and security. Opportunity comes in the form of educational opportunity. And then if you take advantage of a great educational opportunity, the economic opportunity that comes with it, and then when you achieve those two things, you usually can achieve security. Now, eight years ago, our current governor came into places like Irvington and Patterson and Newark and Trenton and Atlantic City and Camden and promised educational justice, economic justice, environmental justice, social justice. We're almost eight years later. I haven't seen any of that. I haven't seen any of that. And so I'm not here to make you promises that I'm not going to keep. What I am going to tell you is that as as your governor, I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure there's every opportunity for each and every New Jerseyian to achieve their dreams right here. And in our urban centers, I think that must start with educational choice. Now, the Democratic Party will often try to say, particularly to minority communities, that we do a better job of representing you than Republicans. They will fight for you. I ask you, who is it that truly has educational choice? People who can afford to send their kids to private school. Who is it that can't afford doesn't get educational choice? People that can't afford to send their kids to private school. Now, that's not just an urban area issue. There's people in the suburbs, too, no matter what their race, creed, or color that may not be able to afford private school. But here's my point. We need to fix the educational system today. Today, in Norc alone, 80% of eighth graders are not on grade level for reading, writing, and math. The data is pretty clear. If you're not on grade level or critical life skills like that, by the time you're done with eighth grade, you will be undermployed most of your life. Okay? And so, we need to get people on grade level. So, what I'm going to do on day one is hold our public school systems accountable all throughout the state. What we need to do is get more rigorous with our academic curriculum. What we need to do is get back to emphasizing critical life skills like reading, writing, and math. There are other things being taught at our schools that I personally believe and I think you're in agreement that belong at home between parents and their children. 100%. What we need in New Jersey is something that Louisiana implemented in the post pandemic when there was so much learning loss because the schools were closed. Here in New Jersey, those schools were closed for two years. This is a governor that opened up our nursing homes but closed down our schools during the pandemic. I want you to think about that for a second. Let me repeat that. He opened up the nursing homes. We closed down the schools for two years and we had significant learning loss in this state. And so what we desperately need is what Louisiana did and something I've been advocating for since the time of the pandemic, a high impact curriculum. What is that exactly? If your child is behind grade level in critical life skills like reading, writing, math, we will spend the entire next marking period and the one thereafter getting them up to speed, getting them on grade level for reading, writing, and math. We need a high school. That's something we can do today. The other thing that we can do tomorrow is provide educational choice with a voucher program like we've seen in Arizona, Ohio, and Florida, and also educational choice through charter schools. Now, during the Christy era, and I didn't necessarily agree with everything that Governor Christie did, but one thing I thought he did right, he opened up charter schools in urban areas. And the charter schools in Newark are some of the best performing schools in the state. And isn't it interesting that every time there was a charter school, there's a lottery to determine who is fortunate enough to get in. And what breaks my heart is each time one of those charter schools has tried to open through the lottery, the demand has exceeded the supply, which means some families were going back to what what they thought was a failing school system. So think about that for a second. So what we can do today is a high impact curriculum. What we can do tomorrow is educational choice through vouchers and through charter schools. And that is the first thing that we need to do quite frankly. Not just in our urban areas but all throughout the state where a school system is failing their students. What determines if a school system is failing their students? Attendance rate, graduation rate, performance on standardized tests, readiness for career if a child is not going to college. Talk to county clerks today. When 18year-olds are coming in to register to vote, they're printing their name on the application. So, if we as a society have decided to stop teaching script or cursive, we're not going to at least teach our children how to sign their name. I mean, even if you have an e document, do you not have to sign your John Hancock? Right. This is what's going on today. So, first and foremost, as governor, my job is to get our educational system back in track all throughout the state, but particularly in those school systems that are failing their students. And with educational opportunity, then comes economic opportunity. So, let's get our schools to be performing well. Something else I want to do in our major urban centers. We need urban revitalization while being very, very sensitive to gentrification. Now, we've seen magnificent urban development, urban renewal on what is called the Gold Coast of Jersey City. There's only one problem with that. gentrification in a very very insensitive way. The people who lived there for decades were relocated, dislocated, and shown no respect for. If we're going to have urban redevelopment, the people who live there now have to be given the first opportunity to take advantage of the economic opportunity that comes with urban rede redevelopment. And so that's what we're going to do in our major urban centers. and in so doing make people of all race, creeds, and color want to live in our urban centers. Again, many of the suburbs that we see all throughout the New Jersey are beautiful, but suburbs are not the engines of economic growth. Vibrant cities are the engines of economic growth. It's vibrant cities. And so, we need to make our cities vibrant again. We see pockets of vibrancy. We see business owners taking it upon themselves to open up their businesses. But what I want to see in our major urban centers are two additional things. One, our banks are not adhering to the commercial lending act. What does that mean? You know what that means? They're not making a certain percent of their loans available to minority communities in our urban centers. That was the whole point of the commercial lending act, so that people of color can get access to capital. As governor, I'll make sure that our banks adhere to commercial lending. What I also want to see us do in our major urban centers is set up through the economic development authority within state government something I call franchise universities where you go and you can attend a course over one two or three months and learn how to own a franchise. Right? And so with the type of urban renewal I've spoken of, and that includes low, moderate, and market rate units, and with the type of economic development I've spoken of, that really touches upon something that's critically important for our minority communities because in this country, you build equity through home ownership, you build wealth through business ownership. and we're not seeing that happen in our communities of color and that's wrong. So, I'm committed to making all that happen. I do want to open up the floor for questions. I'm not somebody that likes a long monologue. I prefer a dialogue and Jessica's not allowed to ask the first question. Okay? She's from Mammoth County. I want to hear from somebody from Irvington. I want to hear from somebody in Essex County. But there's a couple things I want you to know about me before we get to the Q&A. I've already told you that three generations of Cheddarellis have achieved their American dream right here in New Jersey. And I've already told you what my primary motivation is for running. Because of our hard work, three generations of Cheddarellis have all been pretty fortunate. So the point I'm trying to make with the utmost humility is I don't need this job. Well, let me make one thing perfectly clear on your behalf, on our behalf, because we're all in this together. I want the job. Something I love is broken. Something I love is broken. I want to fix it. Leadership matters. I believe this can be fixed. Second thing I want you to know is I'm not owned by any special interests. So, you don't need to worry about me being compromised. I'm not trying to do the difficult things like we've been talking about since I started talking a few moments ago. Things I'm talking about are not easy. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do them. That's right. Right. I always say there's one four-letter word you won't find anywhere in the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution. That four-letter word is easy. Okay? As John F. Kennedy once said when he was talking about us going to the moon, we do this because it's hard. And there's another saying I like in real life. Whatever man has created, man can solve. But there's one I like even more. Best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. That's right. The second best time to plant a tree is tomorrow. Tomorrow's coming real quick. Tomorrow comes in 63 days. It's called election day. And what I say to people all across this state, no matter what their race, creed, or color, if you want change, you got to make a change. Now, I'm not a hyperartisan. I'm a New Jersey. I'm an American. I'm a CEO. I think that this state desperately needs is a hands-on CEO that's going to go to work every day and solve the problems we're talking about today. But you don't need to worry about me being compromised because I'm not owned by any special interests. And the other thing I want you to know is the most important to me because over the last 40 years, Democrats and Republican governors in this state have used this position to try to get somewhere else. So, let me be clear. I've been asked to run for Congress. The answer has been, always will be no. I've been asked to run for US Senate. Answer has been, always will be no. Okay? Nobody's asked me to run for president. But the answer is no. And one other thing, I don't want to write a book. Everybody's writing a book. I just want to fix the state we all love. I want to believe you love it, too. That's why you're here tonight. And together, I'm confident we can do this. If I wasn't, I wouldn't be doing this. But let me say this. when it's all over in four or eight years, I'm going to the beach in Surf City. That's where I hang. Okay. But, uh, this is home. And, uh, I'm excited. I will tell you this. Uh, I really thought we were going to win in 2021. I'm still in therapy. You know how to get me out of therapy with a win. So, I will tell you as I go around the state this time around, the energy is electric. And I'm not just talking about in Republican audiences because one thing I've always prided myself on doing is going places other Republicans don't or won't. And to bring that point home for you all, I want to share something with you. Yes, I've been a business owner over the last 30 years and created jobs for fellow New Jerseyians. But during that time, I also had the privilege of serving two terms in the little town my grandparents immigrated to over 100 years ago, Raritan Burough in Somerset County. And then I left politics after my two terms. And then they recruited me to run for county commissioner in Somerset County. And I won two terms there. And then I left politics again. Demetri, what's that line? They brought me back in and they asked me to run for the state legislature. And I won three two-year terms there. Now, my opponent likes to say I'm a career politician. I turn to myself each and every time. But the point I'm trying to make is that town that I won twice, that county I won twice, and that legislative district where I won three two-year terms, every single time, Democrats outnumbered Republicans, sometimes very significantly. How did I win those races, Jeff? Jeff, by the way, man, this is the 83rd Chedarelli event you've been to. You now have groupy status. The man's a groupy. Let me tell you, I won those races. I've always gone out and talked about the challenges we face each and every day and what my ideas are to solve those challenges. And you know what gets people excited? Ideas. And the biggest compliment I'm ever paid when I leave an event, somebody comes up to me at the end and says, \"You Republican or you Democrat?\" I said, \"Why does it matter?\" Why does it matter? Why does it matter? So with that, Yes sir, you had your hand up. Yeah. Um trade station, New York buildings. At one time they were Can you hear me? Okay. Um, over past decades, our industries, our manufacturers going overseas, over to China, whatever. We need to reshore these industries back here in the United States, and it has a lot to do with we're talking about the bolstering inner cities, Jersey City, New York. What can we do in New Jersey to reestablish that? So, one thing I do not want to be is the governor of a state where more than one out of every two people feels the state's on the wrong track. Two out of three people are looking to leave. It's ranked the worst state in the country in which to retire. We'll talk about that. We're also the worst place in the country to do business. Our taxes, business taxes are amongst the highest. Our regulations are the worst. Our labor pool is shrinking because when our K through 12 kids go out of state to college, they don't come back. And fourth and the most acute right now, energy. You talk about manufacturing, you already know how electricity intensive are manufacturing companies. They use a lot of juice. Has anybody seen what's going on? Your monthly electric bill. What's going on? We are now an electricity importer. We used to be an electricity exporter. When Phil Murphy took office, we had six additional electricity generation plants that he has closed down. He didn't expand our nuclear footprint in South Jersey. He didn't accelerate solar. And where are we today? Energy shortage. And why are all the data centers that are needed to support artificial intelligence located in Pennsylvania, which represents an economic development opportunity, construction, jobs? Pency's got the juice. Why? Because the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is burning seven coal burning plants. I'm not here to have a debate as to whether or not that's good or bad for the environment right now. I'm here to tell you the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is burning seven coal burning plants. He's burning natural gas like there's no tomorrow. He just cut the ribbon on a new nuclear reactor. Pennsylvania's got the juice. It's less expensive. It's reliable, which means there's more money in your pocket each month. and businesses are located in Pennsylvania. My job is to make New Jersey regionally competitive. So those businesses come here. Those businesses come here. Now, so what do they look at? Taxes. The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is lowering their business tax from 10 to 5%. What did the opposing party do here in New Jersey last year? Raised ours from 9 to 11 and a half. I'll lower that just as Pennsylvania is doing over a six-year period to get it down to five so we could be uneven steep, right? Um, what else is Pennsylvania doing? We already know what they're doing when it comes to electricity. They've lessened their regulations, making it less regulatory. Now, I believe that we can lessen regulations here in New Jersey without screwing the consumer or doing irreparable harm to the environment. It's about finding the right balance. You know that uh those coal burning plants in Pennsylvania that are seven of them being used to generate electricity when the westerly's come blowing over the mid-Atlantic states. Where does that air go? Where does our clean air go? Out over the Atlantic. I'm not saying burning coal is a great idea. I think we need to complete the transition from what was coal, then it was oil, now it's natural gas, but you get my point. That Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is open for business. That creates jobs. He's getting manufacturing. He's getting into data centers. He's getting all the above. Right now, we're not. We need to compete. We need a governor who's going to be pro business. We haven't had that with this governor. You need a pro business environment. create that tide that lifts all boats. Now, for the Chedarellis, I have a soft spot in my heart for small business. So, if you're a small business owner in this state, the first $100,000 of business income taxfree. The first $100,000 of payroll exempt from employer payroll taxes. Easier to set up your business. And when it comes time to sell your business, we won't tax the gain on the sale of a family-owned business. Watch entrepreneurship take off in the state. If you added up the total number of people employed by our small businesses, it's more than the number of people employed by the Fortune 100 companies in this state, of which there's only 15 now. You go back to 1970s, New Jersey was home to more Fortune 100 companies than any other state in the country. Now, I just sat down with the leadership of one of our leading corporations, been here for a couple hundred years, and they were very respectful. But here's what they said to me kind of defiantly. We're not leaving New Jersey, but we're not expanding here. They just poured two billion into another state. What would that mean to us? Construction, jobs, all the above. We need to compete. And we will. We will. What's going on, man? I'm praying for you, sir, right now. Right now. God bless. You know, somebody said something before during the introductions um that I think is critically important. My first job as a candidate, my first job as your governor is to listen. Anybody who stands before you and pretends to have all the answers is lying. Now, I'm a CPA, so you want to talk tax code. I go on for hours, but I won't do that to you tonight. That's called unusual punishment, excessive punishment. But there's things we need to do to our tax bill. Um, but my first job is to listen. My first job is to listen. Yes, sir. So we have 564 towns. Each one has a mayor and council or township committee. We have 600 school districts. That's 600 board of educations. We have 21 counties. We've got about 500 different authorities in the state. The bridge authority, the this authority, the that authority. We've got a state government with 120 legislators and then there's one governor. All told, there's about 10,000 people that serve in some type of public office in this state across the state. And wherever there are people, there is unfortunately But let me say this. That's corruption. But let me say this. Um because when you talked about corruption specific Democrats, I don't think Democrats have a monopoly on corruption. So I've been very very clear that I support the president that anyone who came here illegally that has a history of criminality in their country of origin has to go back. I agree. Anyone who came here illegally and committed a crime after coming here has to go back unless that person violated you and we're sending them back to a country that doesn't observe the rule of law and they're not going to be incarcerated upon return. Justice was not served. you were violated. It's not fair for someone to go back and be free. So, if their country is not an ally that observes the rule of law, is going to incarcerate you upon return, we're going to incarcerate you because you deserve justice.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 4 - Jack Ciattarelli on Talkline with Zev Brenner I enjoyed my trip to Israel. This was not my first time, nor will it be my last. Uh but it was a great trip. Um we spent a couple days with business leaders in Tel Aviv and then certainly uh while in Tel Aviv also met with political leaders uh there and in Jerusalem and um it was a great great five days. What impressed you? Cuz you came I believe this the last time you were there was before October 7th. Correct. Last time was 2021 when I was running for governor and um you could just feel right now a little bit of difference in the country. Um people are galvanized as they should be and uh I found in support of the political leadership who's doing everything it can to protect its uh its citizens um and rid the region of terrorists. It's a daunting task. I think the unfortunately we're finding Democrats are abandoning Israel in the United States and even Republicans I think are starting to abandon Israel from what I'm seeing. I hear you on that, but they are an ally uh one of our most critically important allies all around the globe and uh I do think we need to stand strong uh with Israel. Of course, we all want peace. Uh but the way to achieve that is by um stopping with the terrorism and certainly releasing the hostages. No, absolutely. And I think that you know people in Israel galvaniz I think people in in the metro New York area, New Jersey, New York are met are also galvanized because Middle Eastern politics of course is very important but in New York there's a race for mayor and Zoran Mandami is a front runner. He's anti-Zionist, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic. And in fact, I had Shank Shank Shankov, a very wellrespected Democratic consultant. He said that his rise in New York will help you in New Jersey in your race for governor. Well, I certainly don't wish it will on New Yorkers. Um, nor do I want New Jersey to benefit for that reason. Uh, I wish he wasn't a candidate. It's my hope he won't win. Uh, there's no room for that kind of rhetoric in today's world. And, um, it's hate fueled rhetoric. and for him to say that uh Israel as a Jewish state doesn't have a right to exist. Um we've know he's made a number of very offensive comments um even toward Italians. So the the really alarming part to me is that my opponent endorsed him and uh he's endorsed her. I called on her to resin that to reject it. Uh she has not. Um Josh Godheimer, the uh Democratic Congress from North Jersey has condemned Mandami as has Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, but not my opponent. Fascinating. So the race is on and it's getting a little nasty. I've seen ads. I know you're a CPA. You're involved with finance. So the ads were saying, well, if Jacksonelli becomes governor, he promised to raise sales tax 10% and they have a recording. What's that all about? Well, first of all, it's a lie. And the first signs of desperation uh are lying in politics. It's not a pretty business, Zeb. And when it's played by indecent people, it can get downright ugly. Uh I was at a forum where someone was asking me what the tax structure was in other states. And I had made mention of the fact that I just came back from Tennessee where there is no income tax, but a 10% sales tax on all items, including food and clothing, which are sales tax exempt in New Jersey. And uh all I was doing was stating what the tax structure is in Tennessee. I never said that that was the tax structure for New Jersey, but they've turned it into a big lie. And again, I think it's a desperate act by a desperate campaign on the behalf of a desperate candidate. Yeah. What impresses me, I'm not so impressed by it, but it makes an impression on me, is the fact that both in New York and New Jersey when candidates run, they're running not so much against Jack Cerelli in your case, they're running against Donald Trump. They say, “Well, if you vote for Jack Cerelli, it's MAGA. he's going to be voting for Donald Trump. He's not on the ballot, but yet I see that that is that an effective tool because I keep seeing it over and over again in different races. I I think it's a failed strategy. Um actually Donald Trump polls as well as Phil Murphy in New Jersey. He got 500,000 more votes in 24 than Phil Murphy got in 21 in my very very close race. And let's take a look at what he's done for New Jersey. He's put a halt on the wind farms off the Jersey shore. He's beating up on New York Democrats over that congestion pricing plan, which I think is an egregious money grab on New Jerseyians. And uh he's quadrupled the salt deduction on our federal tax returns from 10 to 40,000. Has doubled the child care tax credit uh for parents with young children. He doesn't tax tips, overtime, and social security any longer. And he's created a magnificent tax credit program for people who send their children to private school. And we know there are great many Jewish people that do that. And uh I will opt into that program as governor. Hochul has said she won't. Nome has said he won't and my opponent won't. But those are all the things that Donald Trump has done that are good for New Jersey. So I think it's a failed strategy on their part. I'm going to go out there and continue to talk about all the things that bother New Jerseyians every single day. And I need to tell you Donald Trump isn't one of them. Will Donald Trump be out there campaigning for you between now and election day? We certainly um are in communication with the White House about different ways that they could be of assistance to the campaign and I really appreciate their help and offering up whatever it is we think could be helpful. So yes, we're going to look to leverage that as best we can. I was talking one of my listeners from Lakewood, New Jersey, and he was stating to me that it's an unfair situation. You mentioned schools and parochial schools. He says he's paying his taxes and he is also paying tuition for yeshiva for day school. He said it's unfair that he's not only not getting the benefit from it, he has to pay. It's like double taxation. He shares the sentiments of many, not just Jewish, but also Catholics and other religious parents that send the kid to public school where they're not getting benefit. It's a double taxation. I don't know what it is. Is it 30,000 per child that New Jersey spends on public education? And they feel that there's an injustice here. Uh he is spot on, Zeb. If you send your child to private school in New Jersey, you're paying for schools three times. Your property tax pays for your local public school district. Your um your income tax is paying for districts in places like Newark and Atlantic City and and Trenton. And then your pocketbook is paying for your school tuition. And the the flip side of that calculus you never hear about. Um if all the children that went to private school went to our public school system, the public school system would be a hell of a lot more expensive than it currently is. Oh, I that's one of the reason why I support vouchers kind of programs we've seen in places like Arizona and Ohio and Florida and I certainly support school choice and um you know we need equity when it comes to the funding of public education and also uh some type of tax break for those that send their kids to private school. I totally agree with you. You know people have approached the idea with me that if let's say all the religious schools let's say Lakewood New Jersey and the Catholic schools all enroll in public school I the numbers must be very high could be 50,000 or more it would strain the system send the message do you think system I think it in Lakewood alone you've got 30,000 K through 12 students 24,000 go to private school what would happen to the public school system if all those children went to the public school system I I think we know what the answer is so one If if they if they registered on registration day, would that send the message to lawmakers? So, some people said they're afraid they're going to be accepted to the school and they won't be able to go back to the yeshiva or to their other school. Right. Right. So, you know, I I certainly look at the big picture when it comes to this issue. It's why we have to do something for parents who send their kids to private school. Now, there is, I think you may have alluded to it earlier, President Trump, there's a legislation that will that each state has to opt into which will help fund, you know, private schools and parochial schools, but each state has to sign in. So, as governor, you would have that opportunity to sign in. If you don't opt into it, then you wouldn't get the tax break. You wouldn't get the tuition break. You're exactly right. And so it's a pretty significant tax credit uh for each child that's sent to private school. But again, you have to opt in and as governor, I will. My opponent said she will not. That's a big thing. So, how's the race going for you in the Jewish community? I know you've been going to different places and I hear different events. I saw you at a Jewish Business Alliance event just a few weeks ago. How is it coming along? Really well, Zev. And uh I know I'm going to sound immodest for a second, but no candy has spent as much time in the Jewish community as I have. But then again, I'm up and down the state eight days a week um and been doing this now for almost four years since the time we lost that close election. So there isn't a community in New Jersey I don't spend time in. Uh but I'm always happy to be in our our various Jewish communities around the state, whether it's Teneck, uh Tennifly, Jackson, Tom's River, Lakewood, of course, Lyndon, Jersey City. And uh I want our all people across New Jersey to feel safe. Uh but we know that anti-semitism is at an all-time high. And uh I want our Jewish uh citizen and residents to know that as governor, I'll appoint an attorney general and a superintendent of the state police that are sensitive to the needs and concerns of our Jewish citizens. Our guest is gubernatorial candidate for New Jersey. Jack Ciderell running as a Republican. He ran four years ago. was running again now. Very, very tough race and a nasty race, right? You would characterize as a nasty race, right, Jack? Well, listen, I would not characterize what we're doing as nasty. We're very, very fact-based in what it is that we do. Um, the tail doesn't wag the dog here. I have final say on all content, whether it's on the radio, on a billboard, or on TV. And uh I always try to be uh fact-based in what we do. So, whenever you see us going quote unquote negative, it's usually actually featuring a um the opponent in her own in her own voice, in her own videos of what her positions are. And I think her positions are terribly inconsistent with what it is New Jerseyians want. But Zeb, let me say this. We saw this with John Cororsine. He wasn't from New Jersey, and that didn't work out so well. We saw it with Phil Murphy. He's not from New Jersey, and I think his administration have been a failure. My opponent's not from New Jersey and it's the reason why you see her ducking appearance after appearance after appearance. Uh channel 2 out of New York WCBS tried to have the third debate. She rejected it. I was with one of our largest advocacies for the business community this morning. She did not appear. She rejected it. And uh and now she's going out of state here in the prime time of the campaign season. So, you know, my attitude is if you want this, you want to interview for this job, do your damn homework and show up. She has it. Shouldn't it be mandatory? There should be more debates than they currently are. It just seems that people want to see more of these discussions, debates. I agree with you, Zeb. I mean, by law, there are two and she'll participate in those law in those two. But let me tell you, if it wasn't the law, she wouldn't even participate in those. So, what are some of the cutting issue? I know you mentioned anti-semitism and the problem is is that even when they're caught, they get away with it and they can do it again and again. may and it's my belief I think we've discussed it before when you have crime being rampant and there's no consequence or serious consequence for doing criminal acts then you can feel emboldened to attack Jews and other people so it's all part if you reduce the crime problem it'll help mitigate some of the anti-semitism too at least in my opinion well you're touching upon something that really is on the minds of a lot of people and that there needs to be a consequence there must be a consequence for breaking the law and uh certainly posing a threat to anyone um can be in violation of law and we need to put teeth behind these these hate crimes. Um but you know we're not seeing what happened in Saucus last weekend is another example of there being no consequence no respect for law and order no respect for law enforcement um where a mob took over an entire intersection in in downtown Saucus. We've seen this at the Jersey Shore with the flash mobs. We've seen this with some anti-semitic acts. what took place on our college campuses. There has to be a consequence to bad behavior. When there's not, you need to worry seriously about a whole lot of things breaking down in the community that kind of lead to chaos, mayhem, and self-destruction. You know, if you get to be governor and this is not solvable, President Trump sent troops in New Jersey. Well, what I've said is he won't have to worry about that because as governor, I'll make sure there's law and order. I'll make sure we have safe communities. I'll make sure that no one feels threatened. I'll make sure that our local law enforcement professionals can do their job. We're taking the handcuffs off. So again, whenever anybody's asked me about that, President won't have to worry about sending National Guard New Jersey. We'll take care of matters right here. Now, one of the other issues of course is jobs. It's also the economy. what can be done to stimulate business including a lot of local businesses. I know in Tene and in Anglewood and the like with a lot of Jewish small businesses and from what I'm hearing a lot of them are hurting, especially the restaurants. What we what we desperately need is a pro business governor, a pro business administration and pro business policies. Uh this administration has been anything but. I really believe that it's business that creates the tide that lifts all boats. And so three generations of Chedarellis have all owned their own businesses right here in New Jersey. And I refuse to be the governor of a state that's ranked the worst in the country in which to do business. So we're going to lower business taxes. We're going to lessen regulations. We'll provide the necessary electricity. That's another thing right now that's causing a crisis all across the state. And certainly have to make sure the labor pool is there. And to achieve that, we just need a much more dynamic relationship between the Department of Labor and Department of Education. Is our educational system producing the talent that our businesses need in order to not just survive but thrive? What about taxes? Because this region in New Jersey has also very high tax rate and people going to Florida and Mass. They're going to Texas. What can be done to stop the drain of especially people who are affluent from leaving the state? So, what I'm going to do is very responsibly reduce the size and cost of our state government to afford a tax cut for businesses and individuals. Our business tax is now the highest in the nation. Pennsylvania is on the way to being half of ours. We need to compete. We don't want businesses choosing Pennsylvania over New Jersey. Uh one of the primary reasons for my trip to Israel is that all these these new companies that are thinking about expanding their footprint in the United States, we want them to do that in New Jersey. Uh, Israeli companies do $14 billion a year in bilateral New York, less than $2 billion a year in bilateral trade with New Jersey. There's nothing that um that New York and um so we need to compete and we do that by lowering our tax rates, making it legal offensive again, making sure there's a willing, able uh labor pool and lowering the cost of electricity. No, that's certainly a daunting task and there's a lot of business to be done. It's just a question of stimulating the economy and getting especially small business. I think they're a lifeline. Even some of the big companies have been suffering. You see the restaurant, even McDonald's has gone down in in value. I saw recently. Yep. So, listen, it's across the board. And uh things I want to do to make New Jersey more affordable is do as do in Pennsylvania. All retirement income should be taxfree. It is in Pennsylvania. It's not New Jersey. Freeze property taxes for seniors once they hit age 70. Cap property taxes for first-time home buyers um so they can help get started the first five years of home ownership. Cap it at 1% of the assessed value of the home. Uh make the first two years out of high school or college taxfree. Uh these are all some of the things that we can do to make New Jersey more affordable. Help people retire here. Help people get a start here. Now the Jewish high holiday season is fast approaching with the Russo holiday. Any plans for you Russia Shana? You're going to be going different places, sampling some of the foods. We're eating in the suka. I know that this is a time where you can go hopping from place to place and I'm looking forward to doing that. It's it was a lot of fun uh each and every year to do that and got a lot of Jewish friends all around the state that are happy to help me with that. So, I'm looking forward to it. You have any special message for the new year for our audience? Oh, wishing everyone a wonderful and sweet uh new year. Uh it's it's interesting how how quickly it sneaks up on us, but as I say, you know, this next 62 days, these next two months are going to fly by at warp speed. So, um but we certainly want people to participate in the election process. The Jewish community has a pretty good record of turnout. Uh they're civily civically active and uh certainly participate in the election process. that it's always good to see whenever I talk to other minority groups all around the state, I usually reference the Jewish community as one that gets very very involved with elections and I think sets the standard uh for civic engagement and and election proc election participation. But how do we get even more people involved because the numbers are still not reflected. I believe it's Australia there's mandatory voting. You must vote otherwise you get penalized. We don't have the United States. Maybe it's not a bad idea to do so. But the fact is though there are plenty of people who don't vote. How do we get out? How do we motivate? Because it seems in the Democratic side, you have the most liberal, the most passionate come out and maybe on the Republican side, the most Republican, the more right. How do you get everybody else to get involved? Yep. I mean, Republicans are the minority party in New Jersey and sometimes New Jersey is thought of as a deep blue state. It's not when it comes to gubernatorial elections. Republicans have won six of the last 11 governor races here in New Jersey. That doesn't sound like deep blue to me. So when you educate people about the fact that we do win governor races, uh my job is to inspire and compel and motivate uh the Republican party, which again is the minority party here in the state. But I got to tell you, Zev, given all the things that people are really upset about, whether it's their monthly electricity bill, their property tax bill, public safety, public education, overdevelopment in some of our communities, there's a whole lot of reason to come out and vote this year. And you're never going to hear me say that this is the most important election of our lifetime. I believe every election is equally important for different reasons. But I will tell you, I really do believe the future of our state hangs in the balance. We cannot afford another four years of Phil Murphy policies. And my opponent is Murphy 2.0. We can't afford that. So, I'm hoping that alone compels people to get out. Well, we're going to have to have you on again. So, we appreciate you being with us. Thank you for going to Israel. And I know, like I said, I I used to love when I used to hear everybody went to Israel. Now, it's relatively few candidates that go to Israel. So, I'm glad that's part of your tradition. Well, it's a trip I truly enjoy and part of one of my uh bucket list items is to get there again with my four children. I'm certainly going to get back there again as governor. Uh but I do want to get there with my four children. I think it would be a great great family experience. No, it certainly will be. Jack, thank you and look forward to having you back again very very soon. Thank you, Zeb.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 4 - Jack speech Garfield  Thank you guys. I love energy and energy is what wins elections. Energy is what wins elections. I've never been more committed, never been more determined because of you. never been more energized and never been more confident we're winning this election this year. Now, we got 21 counties in this state and every county plays a role in a statewide election. But know this, it's something I've long known and long say about Bergen County. Bergen County has a greater population than eight states. And the road to a statewide victory goes to Murphy County. And of the 70 towns within this county, we're in one today. Garfield that is the fifth one of the top five counties, one of the top five towns in terms of population. This town matters. And I want to say something about your mayor as I do about all mayors. Yes, we depend on our president for national security, the national economy, international affairs. Yes, we depend on our governor for responses to natural disasters and public education infrastructure, but make no mistake, your daily quality of life in your town is dependent on the job your mayor does. And this guy does it damn well and I'm humbled and honored to have his endorsement. And last weekend I got endorsed by the mayor do. That's right in the middle of the congressional district. My opponent, he's a Democrat. And now another Democrat has endorsed my candidacy. But this mayor is going a step further today. He's changing his party affiliation to Republican. So, your next lieutenant governor, James Ganon, the Sheriff Morris County, and I want to welcome your mayor to the right side of the aisle. I know one of the things that excited your mayor so much was my choice for lieutenant governor, a 40-year decorated local law enforcement officer working to support the men and women that will from day one of our administration. Now, the press is going to ask me, what do you think is it that led the mayor to convert to Republicans? Did the Democrats leave him any choice? For the past 7 and 1/2 years, every single policy has been a failure under the current administration. Policies that are supported by my opponent, whether it was housing, look what's happening with the overdevelopment of our communities, with regard to property taxes because of a flawed school funding formula. with regard to public safety because they don't support law enforcement. With regard to the public education curriculum where we slip from 2 to 12 on the National Park Guard, these are the failures of the current administration and that all changes on day one of our administration. We take power in.  So, in many respects, this is kind of an easy decision for the mayor. But make no mistake, changing parties is a very courageous decision. And we applaud you, mayor, for your courageousness. And I know the mayor joins me and your next lieutenant governor on what it is that happens on day one of this administration. Executive order number one, on day one, no town in this state will be a sanctuary city and we will not be a sanity. On day one of this administration, we get an attorney general appointed by me that supports both our police and our parents when it comes to policing. That means getting rid of cashless bail. We have professional criminals that learn how to game the system. Talk to your wonderful cops about arrest, release, repeat. It's real. It's demoralizing. There's got to be a consequence for breaking the law, and there will be under my administration. That attorney general also supported me in getting rid of policy 5756 in our schools. The notion of school districts keeping secrets from parents is immoral. It's indecent. It's wrong. And it's dangerous. It depends on day one of my kids. On day one of my administration, we'll go before the Supreme Court and make a case for stopping all this overdevelopment in our suburban community. We'll make a case for getting a new school funding for us so communities like this will get their fair share of state funding for our schools. And on day one, I'm calling for the resignation of all those that sit on the state board of education that have made all those offensive changes to our public school curriculum. We're getting back to basics, teaching critical life skills to our schools with an age appropriate curriculum and one that respects parents. This is what this election is all about. And I'll tell you what, as I go around this state, it's not just Republicans who are crying out for change. its unaffiliated independent voters and yes, even moderate Democrats who've come to the realization that this current administration has failed New Jersey. Make no mistake, we cannot afford another four years of Bill Murphy's failed polit. And my opponent is Murphy 2.0. Make no mistake. Now, what I see the Democrats doing is something they've done before that has failed. John Cororsine came here from Illinois. That didn't work out so well. Phil Murphy came here from Massachusetts. That hasn't worked out so well. My opponent's not from New Jersey. So, I got a really neat idea. How about we elect the Jersey guy? How about we elect the Jersey guy? like your mayor. I've been here my entire life. This is home. Always has been, always will be. And you don't need to worry about me getting distracted because I don't want to be congressman. I don't want to be US senator. I don't want to be president. I don't want to write a book. I just want to fix the state we all love and it can't be fixed.  So, here's what we're going to do over the course of the next 62 days. Jim G and I with the help of your mayor and a whole lot of other people here in this room are going to continue to go all around this state. 564 towns, 21 counties, North, Central, South and Jersey Shore, and yes, all 600 diners. I've been to every one of them. We're not going to rest. We are going to carry our message up and down this state of how we go about fixing New Jersey. Now, fasten your seat belt cuz here's what my opponent's going to do for the next 62 days. If you get a flat tire on the way home tonight, she's going to blame it on President Trump. Okay? She's going to tell you for the next 62 days that she's a woman. The mayor's asked me to remind you that I'm a man. She's going to tell everybody she's a mother of four. I'll tell you I'm a father of four. She's going to tell you she's an attorney. I'll tell you I'm a CPA. She's going to tell you she knows how to run a helicopter. I'm going to tell you she doesn't know a damn thing about running the state of New Jersey. Actually, let's elect somebody who actually knows what the hell is going on. The Chedarellis have been here for a hundred years. Three generations of Chedarellis have achieved their American dream right here in New Jersey. My grandfather worked his way up out of the ditch, became a very successful independent contractor. My parents were very successful restaurant bar owners. I could not have asked for two better parents. They were people of integrity, people with a great work ethic, and they reminded my three siblings and me every single day of our responsibilities to each other, to our family, to our community, our state, our country, telling us never to expect anything other return than the American promise of opportunity. It was also in that house that my parents reminded my three siblings and I that in that house we had no rights. We got one friend at the age of 18 the right to leave. My mother used a wooden spoon. Oh, the deputy mayor, too. Isn't that vote? I was working the Jersey Shore last week and I saw a guy that had a t-shirt that said, \"I survived the wooden spoon.\" I went and got that vote, mayor. I went and got that vote. I followed in my grandparents and parents footsteps, and I'm a two-time business owner here in the state. But all along the way, I've had the privilege of serving two terms at the municipal level as a council president in Somersson County, Rarenburg, where my grandparents immigrated. Two terms in Summersson County, where we used to call the freeholders. Three two-year terms in the general assembly, determine myself each and every time. I know what's going on here in the state of Jersey. I'm not afraid to make the bold decisions to turn things around. And you can depend on me. I will not lose my focus. each and every day. We're going to roll up our sleeves and we're going to fix this damn state of California. And if I didn't believe it to be done, I wouldn't be asking you for the privilege to serve as your governor. But make no mistake, whether it's four or eight years, I'll give you all that I've got. When it's all over, I'm going to the beach in Surf City. This is home. always has been, always will be. And I want to thank you all for being here today. Mayor, thank you for the endorsement. Thank you for the courageous decision. His switch to Republican reminds me of something Ronald Reagan once said. I didn't leave the Democratic party. It left me. And so together with your help, we'll get it done. 60 62 days, all gas, no break. Let's get it done time. Let's get it done. You know what the theme of this campaign is? It's time. It's time. Let's get this done. Let's get this done. Let's go. It's time. It's time.  Let's go. Let's go.  There they are.",

    "transcript_text": "Sept 5 - Sherrill appearance on Democracy Docket Mikey Cheryl, welcome to Defending Democracy. Well, thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. All right. So, you have been one of the bright spots and rising stars among Democrats in the House and now you are running for governor of New Jersey. So, tell me about that decision, why you decided to to run for governor and and uh and what you hope to get done. Sure. Um, I think in these times where we are seeing power in the Democratic party and just uh power to really expand our support for people and focusing an agenda on driving down cost and pushing back against the, you know, all of the economic harm being done by the Trump administration is really in these governor's offices. Um, and so running for governor, as I looked at it, was the best way that I could support the people of New Jersey. I have four kids. Um, I want to create opportunity for them going forward. I want to make sure they have the same opportunity that I had, but also the same protection for their rights and freedoms. And I want to create that for every kid in New Jersey. So, it used to be not that long ago uh that the New Jersey and gubanatorial elections were like the bellweather elections, right? These were the these were always uh in the off year after a presidential election and everybody would be like let's see what's happening in New Jersey. Let's see what's happening in Virginia because that'll tell us a lot about the national uh mood. And I still think that's true although I think that there is so much else going on in the in politics uh that uh that people are paying attention to. Maybe there's a little bit less national attention. So for people who have not been focused on the state of the race, you're running against a complete lunatic. Those are my words, not yours. Uh, but we have to take every lunatic seriously in these in this day and age. Uh, uh, so tell us just a little bit of the lay of the land of the race right now as it stands and kind of how you see it playing out. Obviously, you think you're going to win, but like how do you see the political landscape right now? Yeah. So, I would just start by saying I think New Jersey is the most critical election in the nation going on right now. And I say that because um we've had I will not tell Congresswoman Spanberger that you said that. Oh, you can tell her. She She argues this bit with me all the time. She happens to disagree. So, as you might expect, but I'd say because this is really um this has been a really intense election. From last November when I entered into it, we had six people in the Democratic primary uh representing almost every part of our Democratic party. And so, you know, everyone came to weigh in on the path forward here. We had record turnout, record setting turnout. 840,000 Democrats showed up. Just to give you a sense of scale here in New Jersey, last year a presidential primary, which is generally a larger turnout, was 550,000. And um now we are in this competitive general election with my opponent Jack Chidarelli who um you know came within three points of our incumbent governor in the last race. This is the third time he's running for governor. and um we also slid 10 points to the right in the 2024 presidential cycle. So I think this is a real test of where not only New Jersey is but where this country is going and how people feel about the leadership of Donald Trump. And um I I think we're going to see these results really making an impact on either the wind in our sales in the Democratic party for 2026 or man a huge blow to uh the agenda going forward if if we don't um have a great race here and I think we can. I also will tell you that this to me is an opportunity. There is a lot of um I think frustration about where Democrats are and what they are doing going forward. We have seen here in New Jersey as you you heard from you know kind of the turnout in the primary. Democrats here in New Jersey are feeling very engaged. I I don't get questions where's Democratic leadership. Everyone in New Jersey knows what's going on here, who's at the table, who's fighting hard and they're ready to join the fight. Um, so, so we are seeing the idea of attacking the economic harm that's being done in Washington from Donald Trump. The five billion dollar hit to our budget, the um tariffs which are putting small businesses out of business and raising costs on everybody. The one big beautiful bill attacking Medicaid and uh education funding for example, among many, many other things. and focusing on how Trenton itself can run better and how we can drive down cost here. And that's really compelling to everyone. So I think this is what we can build. I'll just end by saying the thing that to me is so troubling is to see that every time we see this mounting democratic excitement and engagement, we're able to build that here in New Jersey. I see thousands of people. We have 564 municipalities. I mean, we have more municipalities in California. So we are everywhere seeing everybody. Every time that excitement builds in New Jersey that there is a wet blanket that continues to get thrown on this on social media, online, in some of the cable news programs um about Democrats. And I think we're building something really important here. And it's interesting that that there are a lot of people at work to try to to stop that in its tracks. Yeah. I you know it's interesting you you touch on something that I wanted to get to before we talk about the general election which is your primary. Um you know I think that that that one of the most undercovered political stories of the year was your success in that primary. Uh and I'm not you know I'm not looking to criticize anyone else or or be uh uh you know get into a whole debate about about uh you know across the river what you know in the New York City primary. But but the fact is you you won a a very very as you point out competitive primary that was really ideologically diverse and people who don't know New Jersey don't know it's one of the hardest states to campaign in generally but in particular a primary because you have a New York City media market and you have a Philadelphia media market. So it's not like it's not like you know there is a natural you know home for to get known statewide in New Jersey. you really have to compete with a lot of news from from other places. And you put together a really extraordinary coalition uh that spanned from sort of center left to left uh and uh uh and I don't think that's gotten enough notice. And so talk a little bit about that primary election and why that is in fact, as you point out, and these are my words, not yours, an example of how Democrats nationally can sort of conceive of how you put together a a winning coalition. Well, I think my frustration has often been that the path to democratic success is not that difficult to discern. I'd say we've seen it as far back as 2018 when I first ran. And what you heard people at that time running on that people who were successful at building broad coalitions, flipping Trump districts and holding those districts and and connecting to people across their state was were kitchen table issues. And so when you see who's continued to develop these broad coalitions and have greater success in the Democratic party, you see people like Alyssa Slackin, you see people like Abigail Spanberger now running in Virginia who who have run really focused on how in elected office they can make families lives better. You know, that's what it comes down to. I mean, there's a lot of people that can do a lot of things in the world, but there's only one person that can be governor of New Jersey, and that person has to make sure that you can afford your electric bill, right? I I mean, among many other things, but at the end of the day, brass tax, the person you elect should make your life better, your opportunity stronger, your kids' future brighter. And I think when Democrats get away from that, and and there's a lot of talk about, oh, we talk about niche issues, we do this. No, we can protect rights and freedoms everywhere. I've served in the military. I've taken oaths to the Constitution. There's no vulnerable community that I'm going to back away from and say, \"Oh, you're unpopular, so I'm not going to talk about you.\" That is not the problem. The problem is when you're not leading with a strong and aggressive message on creating opportunity and driving down cost at a time when we see a president who is using every lever to pad the bank accounts of anybody with the last name Trump, you need to focus on working people. You need to make sure that you are delivering a government that is going to deliver on opportunity. And if you're not doing that and focused relentlessly on that, then you're really missing the boat. And I think we've seen that over time. Um, but again and again and again, it comes down to kitchen table issues. And yes, I care deeply about so many issues that are going on at the federal level right now. I care deeply about things that I I have served all over the world. I know what US programs can and have done for growing democracy and opportunity and economic stability across the world. I know what they do here at home and how they deliver um success here at home in economic opportunity. But at the end of the day, I think as Democrats, we need to start our focus with working people. And if we're not doing that, we're going to we're not going to succeed. Yeah. I think the other thing that you've done which you didn't mention but I'll I'll add to this um is that you know I think voters want someone who they feel is like fighting for them and part of that is the issue set that that you talk about like they have to be issues matter but they also want someone who's going to stand up for them and fight and fight hard and and I think that we sometimes uh in politics there is a confusion between ideology uh and fighting and you know you can be a moderate who fights, you can be a a a liberal who fights, you can be a progressive who fights, and likewise, you can be all those things and and not. And I think that a lot of your success is that I think talking to people I know in New Jersey. I grew up just on the other side of the border in Rothland County, New York, just across the border from Mawa. In fact, all my youth was spent basically in Bergen County, New Jersey. Um, and talking to people I know, like there's just a sense that like you are taking the fight for them and for New Jersey, uh, both in Congress, but also in your, uh, as a candidate. I think that's so important right now because I think people are very skeptical of um, you know, elected officials. I think I I say this is the least partisan race I've run because people are just exhausted by both parties. And so in the Navy, we always say you need to find a way or make one. There's not a lot of, oh well, I'm going to try to do this and or I'm going to promise you the world and not deliver it. You either find a way to move forward and if that way is not obvious, then you create that pathway. And that's what a good public servant does for people is finding pathways even if they're not there. And if if we have learned anything in these past several years, it's that you have to move aggressively and quickly or you are going to get rolled. And I think the people of New Jersey want to see a leader who is not going to make some vague promises of, you know, opportunity and affordability without brass tax and this is how I'm going to do it. And I don't care who stands in the way. So to have my opponent suggest that he's going to do whatever Trump says and he said he can't think of any way he disagrees with him or to say that he is going to it's his job to support the president. Excuse my French. right? Like yeah, it is the job of the governor of New Jersey to support the people of New Jersey. And I have taken on everyone including really powerful members of the Democratic party when it comes to serving the people of New Jersey. That's what families deserve. That's what they need. And I think that's what is going to be on the ballot this November. Yeah. So, let's talk about your opponent because I think I I introduced him as um a right-wing lunatic. Uh which I think he is. Uh but you're right. He also came closer to beating Phil Murphy in the last gubanatorial election than frankly I think people predicted. So, you know, we have to take you have to take your opponents seriously. uh uh that that they are you run you know good candidates like you you run the race aggressively and you don't you you know you don't assume that the other that the other uh the other candidate won't you know have an a message that he can that he will try to try to run on. Um but I have to say like he is an he would be an unusual fit for New Jersey given that New Jersey is you know a a blue state. It is it has its areas but it It is a state that believes uh in progress. It believes in science. Uh it believe it is a pro-choice state. Uh uh it is a state that is part of the economic engine of the country. And it's also a state that Donald Trump has targeted for punishment, which by the way is in and of itself a whole other conversation we could have. I mean, the the way in which the the pettiness with which he has treated the the the citizens of New Jersey make it a weird thing for your opponent to run a campaign as essentially the proxy for Donald Trump. So, tell me why uh tell me why we should I we should be more worried than than maybe we are. and also, you know, how you're how how you take on a candidate that is so far outside the mainstream of New Jersey Republicans who in the past have succeeded by being frankly very moderate and this guy's not right. So, the person who is the moderate in the race um has yet to endorse him and I don't think will endorse him because he is um really too far to the right for New Jersey. But I guess the threat here is that when you know here in New Jersey when we see what goes on in some of the Republican rallies and stuff, I think there's a vision of um people who follow Donald Trump and are too far to the right. There's a certain vision of how they might look like a January 6 protester or something. And so we often have people in New Jersey who are following 100% of what the president does. vote 100% in line with him. Um, say things like, you know, I can't think of anything I disagree with the president on, are willing to have an abortion ban like Jack Chidarelli or to raise taxes every time he's in elected office like Jack Chidarelli. Um, again and again, uh, supporting, he said, you know, people are going to have to experience pain to support Trump's tariffs. Now, why would the people in New Jersey support Trump's tariffs on coffee beans from Brazil? Nobody in America grows coffee beans. there's no reason to support Trump's tariffs on coffee beans from Brazil. And there's no reason that the people of New Jersey should feel pain because he's doing that, right? And so again and again and again, he's had these extreme positions where he's advocated for the president, not the people. And yet, because of this vision of what maybe a Trump supporter looks like, if you wear a collared shirt and you kind of smile as you're going around diners, there has been this sort of wolf and sheep's clothing thing that goes on here where people come off as a nice neighbor guy while they're supporting all these really bad positions that harm the people here. And I think that's, you know, what we're facing and that's why I'm running so hard. If I have heard once, I've heard a hundred times in this race. Run like you're 10 points behind. And I think that's really good advice because it's up to me to make sure people realize how he has actually voted when he's in office and what he himself has said about what he would do as governor. Because I think if people hear that, they realize how out of step and out of touch he is with people in New Jersey. Yeah. And look, I mean, everyone in New Jersey needs to recognize Donald Trump raised your taxes. Like Donald Trump, you know, and so when you have a guy running for governor who's supporting Donald Trump, like he raised your taxes. He is targeting the industries that that drive the economic engine of New Jersey, both the large businesses like, you know, the pharmaceutical industry and others, but also the small businesses, you know, the small businesses that make New Jersey really such a dynamic economy. And Donald Trump is doing all of those things. And this guy, this Republican, rather than saying, you know, I'm running as, you know, someone who is a different kind of Republican. I don't agree with everything. You know, look, I I I don't think much of Kelly Ayat or or Cenounu in New Hampshire or even Phil Scott in in Vermont, but they at least try to say like they're not, you know, they're Republicans, but a different kind of Republicans. At least try to pretend they're reasonable, right? But this guy, this guy is like, \"No, no, no. I'm Trump.\" Yeah, I'm Trump. Yeah. Yeah. No, he's he's, you know, visited him. Every time he comes here, he gets his little butt to Bedminster as quickly as possible. even took a helicopter from Atlantic City, paid I think, you know, quite a bit of money to just go kiss Trump's ring. Um, so every opportunity he has tied himself closely to Donald Trump and at every opportunity uh has has really failed to ever stand up for the people of New Jersey. So, you're exactly right. It's um it's really problematic. And I'll tell you, you know, when we see what Trump has done here, it's it's striking. I mean, I speaking of coffee beans, I was speaking to, you know, this guy Chuck, who owns a brewery, a a coffee roaster and coffee shop, and um he was saying that a a big burlap sack of coffee beans used to cost him $2.50. And then as he put it, when Trump got in some political fight with the guy in Brazil, now that bag is $7 and he said, \"I just had to tell my customers. I I held off. I held off. I was hoping that, you know, the tariff would go right.\" He goes, \"I I have to raise costs.\" So, we're seeing costs going up everywhere, which stands in such sharp contrast to the promises that were made about lowering cost. and to see then someone running for governor who's just going to go right along with that. I mean, I have to tell you at every level, you're exactly right. Trump attacks New Jersey. In fact, my the thing that, you know, I was once called the tunnel obsessed congresswoman because we were trying, it took years to get the Gateway Tunnel Project getting its fair federal share. And under the Trump administration, he would have infrastructure week every week and yet failed on every level to do anything about that Hudson River tunnel. And it just it blew my mind. I'm like, this is such a huge economic benefit for the whole Northeast Rail Corridor um for businesses, for families getting around, for commuters in my district. And again and again, he just, you know, refused to do something like that. And I think you're you see that in this administration, the attacks on New Jersey, the $5 billion hit u just to our state budget. The fact that we sent $70 billion more to the federal government than we returned and now they're not even going to run the Medicaid programs or the education programs that they're on the hook for. The fact that he's attacking power generation here in the Northeast. So we know those costs which have already gone up steeply are going to go up by hundreds of dollars. So again and again and again you see these attacks and that's why I'm running as a governor who is going to take on that administration for the people of New Jersey. All right. Let me ask you about some specific uh issues wearing both your current hat and your future hat. So um we are all uh waiting to see what happens on September 30th uh which is when the federal government budget runs out uh and there is a lot of talk that there may be a shutdown. Um it seems to me, but I am not an expert in policy outside of voting in elections. Um it seems to me that Donald Trump keeps shutting down the parts of the government he wants to shut down. So tell people like what is the fight? What is what is what is happening on September 30th uh uh which you'll still be a member of Congress for and kind of what the stakes what the stakes are for New Jersey. But actually even more broadly than that. I'll be right back with more of my conversation with Mikey Cheryl in a moment. But you know, in 2020, I started Democracy Docket to help cover voting rights, free and fair elections, and everything involving democracy. Now that the Department of Justice has been turned into Donald Trump's political weapon, the Democracy Docket team is growing to meet this moment. So, please support their work by becoming a premium member now at the link above or in the description below. And please also make sure to like and subscribe to this channel and hit the bell to make sure you get notified whenever we post a new video. So, we are um facing a government shutdown on September 30th if we either don't pass the budget or if we don't have what's called a continuing resolution, meaning we'll just continue this budget that we're on. Now, continuing resolutions are a really poor way to run a government. So, I come out of uh the House Armed Services Committee and we have to cancel all kinds of programs and lose millions and millions of dollars if the new budget doesn't come online to kind of pay for the updates to the programs. So, we pass the programs. If we don't pay for the updates, then that we lose all this funding when you have to restart. It costs millions more than it should. So, it's really So, it actually cost the federal government money. It cost the federal government millions and millions of dollars. Um, and so it's a bad way to do it to begin with, but uh, there is, you know, but we're getting to the point where we neither have a budget that can pass because remember in the Senate, you you have to have a super majority. You can't just pass it with a majority like in the House. And so, um, you need to go have a negotiation with Democrats to get this passed. That's how normal times would operate. Um, we also are seeing a lot of discontent. You saw it. Um, I know you've had Lam Monica Maccgyver on your program and so, um, as you've probably talked about, you know, we have Alina Haba here illegally as the US attorney right now. Um, she's using her office, my old office to attack um, Democrats like Lam Monica MacGyver who's who was performing oversight. Now there's a trumped up case against her. So then the over so then the in Congress they tried to um censure her and that failed. So Republicans came over and said no this is getting ridiculous. So, the fact that you're starting to see some of these cracks in the um you the blind loyalty to Trump is going to make it uh problematic as they try to pass this budget when we already know all of the attacks that people are facing um all of the costs that are going up on tariffs. So, that's going to be a big fight. And I also think that um there's a there's sort of a disagreement that you might hear a little bit about in the Democratic party because some people I think are sort of treating this like normal times like you know we just wait till 28 we vote them out and then we repeal what we need to repeal and then we move forward. And I would say that's a really I would say that's a wrongheaded look at what's going on in the world because it's not just Trump. It's a reworking of the world order. It is uh the postcoid, you know, problems that we're still facing. It's uh AI. It's just a an incredibly changing economy. And then a a an instability that Trump has added to this. And all of that is going to take a lot more than just a regular election 28. I was there on January 6. I was on the floor of the House. He's not leaving. He's He's not leaving willingly. So, it's going to take a lot more to make sure that we get back to our democratic norms, that we get an economy that works for people, and that we can move forward in a different way. And so, this CR is where the rubber is going to meet the road because I think a lot of us have been pushing to say you cannot give away power ever. You can't ever give away power right now. Nothing. No quarter given. That is the only way forward if you are going to get anything done. And so this is the real test because I think we saw um the people who thought this was going to be normal times in this last type of fight help move this forward. And I think now we're drawing a line and hopefully those same people are realizing no we're in different times. So that's the demand right now by myself and many of us, you know, saying, \"No, you if if they need your vote, then you need to get something for it because too many people, too many vulnerable people right now are at risk if you go along with anything the president's doing.\" All right. The other question I've got to ask you, because I've asked this of every Democratic member of the House and Senate who I've had on, do your Republican colleagues, do they know what they're doing? Like like like I've had different I've had different sort of perspectives on this. There are the folks who say, \"Yeah, no, they're all or not all, but many of them actually believe what they say and what Donald Trump is doing.\" Then there are then some of your colleagues have said, \"No, they're actually just afraid.\" like a lot of them do know what they're doing is wrong, that Donald Trump is an authoritarian, but that they're afraid either for their physical safety or for their electoral prospects. So, I got to ask you, like, you know, I I I found myself screaming at C-SPAN. Yes. C-SPAN. When I would listen to Republicans in New York and New Jersey and elsewhere, and like they're getting in this in the salt tax debate, like they were getting screwed. And yet they were like bending over backwards to be like, \"Well, we will never give him the votes.\" And then they give him the votes. like like you know like like do they know that that what they are doing in in you know sending troops into cities into you know into stripping abortion rights into defying court orders like do they know that they are supporting what they're supporting is wrong or are the Republicans in the house who you serve with they just like don't care yeah they know it's wrong I mean you'd have to basically have a labbotomy to not know it's wrong right this is ridiculous they know exactly exactly how wrong it is. And don't forget, they're not just screwing themselves. They're screwing the 750,000 people that they're supposed to be serving and standing up for. So, I hear all the time from, you know, I have um you know, I'm a military veteran. I served in the Navy. So, uh I know a lot of veterans who know a lot of veterans across the aisle and oh, they feel awful. They know it's wrong. They hate him. They disagree. Blah blah blah. So, quit. Nobody's, you know, there's no gun to your head to run for office. If you're doing the wrong thing, then you're part of the problem. And then this idea that that I think so many of them have convinced themselves of, oh, I have to be here because if it wasn't me, somebody worse would be here. Yes. This is what they say all the time. Every single thing that Donald Trump tells you to do, why are you any better? You're not. Quit. It's time. just you know what there are times when you're standing up and you're fighting from the inside and there are times when you're becoming complicit and I'd say I think that's why Don Bacon's leaving because he has tried at different times to stand up. I think Congressman from Nebraska he's becoming complicit and it's time to go. You mentioned Lam Monica MacGyver. Um I've had her on and I've written and covered extensively the travesty that's going on there. She was uh she's been indicted for doing her job as a member of Congress. people who want the background, they can go watch video I did with her. I also had on Congressman Mendez to talk about uh the situation. And everyone should know that, you know, you took time out of your uh uh out of your uh campaign schedule. And there is nothing more precious than time in the closing months of a campaign. And you went back to support her uh because Republicans were targeting her as you mentioned. And you deserve a lot of credit for that. you deserve an enormous amount of of our gratitude and our thanks because it would be an easy vote to miss. Uh in some ways it's kind of like theatrics of Republican, but you went back and you stood up for what is right. And so I want to give you an opportunity to address that and also just the absolute travesty of what's going on there. Well, I I certainly don't deserve all the the credit you're loing on me. I appreciate it, but thank you. But no, it was just the of course the right thing to do. Um there was a procedural vote and I was worried that procedural vote would go through. So I I headed down to DC in the event that um the procedure for putting the censure motion on the floor passed so I could vote against it. Luckily it failed. Luckily some number of Republicans came out against it, which like I said speaks to some people realizing that the time to weigh in is now. Um and so uh what happened was um there's an ICE detention facility against the laws of New Jersey at Delaney Hall here in New Jersey. So New Jersey has said no private detention facilities. Um I worked as a federal prosecutor and um and and will tell you, you know, many of the private detention facilities are rife with mistreatment of of prisoners, including uh the ones that GEO runs. They have a history of abuse and then they gave millions of dollars to Donald Trump's campaign and were given authorization to open up a det private detention facility in New Jersey. So L Monica went to perform oversight duties along with Rob Menendez, Bonnie Watson, Coleman um to make sure that at the minimum people were being treated appropriately in that detention facility. Mayor Ros Baraka went with her. Um the members of Congress were invited in. Mir Raz Baraka was invited into the gate. Um and then he was asked to leave and so he left and on his way up as soon as he got out they arrested him. Yep. And uh Alina Haba who was put into the US attorney's office in New Jersey for a limited period of time. You're allowed to put someone in temporarily. That time has um has ended and she should not be in there right now. and there are numerous court cases uh pending right now about that. So, um she from the start has said she was going to use her office to turn New Jersey red. Completely inappropriate. Um but then decided to go after the mayor and to arrest had him arrested inappropriate, you know, got the call. Uh then of course all the tapes came out and um it was obviously very inappropriate. So she had to release him. So then she went after Lam Monica Maccgyver to make her case against her who was a sitting member of Congress performing her oversight duties. Again, completely inappropriate and then the Congress said they were going to censure her. So that's why I went down there. Luckily, it failed. Cooler heads prevailed. Um but still I mean speaking of people who are really standing in the breach right now continuing to do their job despite an administration coming after them you know uh Representative Macgyver is doing that as along with many many others um who are putting themselves at risk just fighting for very basic things rights and freedoms for people across this country. All right. So, um I want to end where we began, uh which is with your election because I I agree with you. I'm not going to take sides between Virginia and New Jersey. So, I'm going to say it's a tie as to which is the most important, what is the most important. Remember your your all the wonderful days in Bergen County you spent. Oh my god. And I you know, you and I could talk sometime about the time the the amount of time I have spent in New Jersey. You know, my first the first trial I ever had was in the New York uh the New York courthouse. I I tried to I had a six-week trial before Judge Lifeland, who at the time uh was was on the bench. But anyway, um I'm not going to take sides in that uh in that. But I will say that the New Jersey election is the most important political story right now. um along with Virginia um you know there's a lot of time and attention being spent on other things in politics and they are important and I cover them including the release of the Epstein files the um the attacks on democratic institutions the capitulation of the media and universities and others but ultimately what's going to set the tone for 2026 is going to be what happens in November of 2025 and so you know there is a huge difference between you winning by three points and you winning by 10 points. Uh and so I think it's really important that everybody in the Democratic Party world and the audience here uh is paying attention and doing what they can do. So let me sort of ask you two questions. One is for people in New Jersey um how do they how do they uh how do they help? How do they vote? Uh when is the election? What is the what what do you need? You need yard signs? Like what can they do? and people outside the state of New Jersey, what should they be doing to help amplify your message and your your cause? Great. Thank you so much. Please, please, please, to everyone in New Jersey and across the country, go to my website, mikeysherald.com/vunteer. Uh if you're if you're here in New Jersey, if you want to come to New Jersey, we can set you up with canvasing, door knockocking. Um you can phone bank from anywhere. You can text bank, uh get involved in some postcard writing. We have so many different options for how you can make a difference in this really critical critical election. Um, and we would welcome it. If you want a yard sign, uh, reach out, let us know. We're we're kind of carting them to all of our events so we can tell you when an event near you is. We have regional directors up and down the state. So, uh, I just I want to remind all my friends in Pennsylvania, everyone I knew in New Jersey was knocking doors last year. So, come on, repay the favor. uh get over here because um we could use the help and it's a a critically critically important election and um these results as you said are going to make a huge difference here in New Jersey as we're seeing Trump attacking everyone across the country um as we're seeing him really uh you know threatening National Guard. We saw that great decision yesterday, I think it was in California, saying how illegal some of this police force against the Posiccomatus Act and having uh federal troops as a police force on the ground. So, we're going to keep pushing back. It's important to have strong Democratic governors in that fight. So, that's another reason New Jersey is so important. Um and then um we can uh continue to make sure that we're keeping New Jersey blue but also setting the table for the future of the Democratic Party.",

Because our individuals and our businesses pay the highest taxes in the country. I, as an NBA CPA, will go down to Trenton, not Washington. I'm not going to Washington. We'll go down to Trenton. I'm going to very responsibly reduce the size and cost of our state government to afford a tax cut for our individuals and for our businesses. I'll give you a new school funding formula which will lower your property taxes. Okay, those are some of the things we got to do right out of the gate. The other thing we're going to address here in New Jersey, I'm going to appoint an attorney general on day one that supports our local law enforcement. We need safe communities right here in New Jersey. I'll give you a new state board of education on day one that will fix our public school curriculum. Okay. Tell you something else we're going to do on day one. We're going to go before the state supreme court and make an argument on things they don't know about. But we're going to stop the overdevelopment through this mount Laurel housing doctrine laws. You know, the Democrats like to portray themselves as the pro-environmental party. How can you be the pro- environment when you're allowing all this overdevelopment to take place in our rural communities? They're taking garden right out of the Garden State. It's one of the top issues in this campaign. So, we're going to continue to talk about the issues. Now, my opponent seems to only want to talk about two things. Donald Trump. Donald Trump and Donald Trump. Okay, that's a mistake. I'm going to continue to go out and talk about New Jersey. And by the way, what does it Donald Trump has to do with us having the highest property tax in the nation? What does he have to do with what's recently happened to your monthly electric bill? What does he have to do what's happened to our public education system? What does he have to do with the lack of support for law enforcement that's caused the rise in nonviolent crime all across the state? He's got nothing to do with those things. We have everything to do with those things. and our governor in particular. And make no mistake, it's on every one of those things that Phil Murphy has failed us for the last four years. So, we're going to continue to get up and down the state. And um over the next 60 days, we're going to remind people who my opponent really is. This is somebody that supported Joe Biden's open border policies. This is somebody that supported all of his inflationary economic policies. This is somebody that voted no on the Lake and Riley Act. Now, let me see if I get this. You came here illegally, broke the law once. While you're here, you committed a crime, broke the law twice. we're not going to detain and deport you. She voted no on that bill. This mother of two daughters voted yes twice to allow biological males to participate in female sports. That's one of those 8020 issues here in New Jersey. Okay. This is somebody that voted no on President Trump's budget bill. The one that lets us deduct $40,000 of property taxes on our federal tax return. The one that doubles the child care tax credit for parents with young children. The one that doesn't tax tips, social security, and overtime. the one that provides a magnificent tax credit for those who send their kids to private school. And I know some of you are here today. She voted no on that bill. She endorsed the socialist Democrat out of New York, Mandami. And two weeks ago, he returned the favor and endorsed her. This is somebody who's now favor. This is someone who had to pay federal fines for stock trades and stock reporting. She broke the House rules for a congressperson. And the New York Times reports that while she was sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she was trading defense stocks. This is somebody who's not really about you or about New Jersey. This is somebody who's really all about herself. But we've seen this before, have we not? The Democrats brought John Cororsine here from Illinois. That didn't work out so well. They brought Bill Murphy here from Massachusetts. I don't think that's worked out so well. And I think you agree she's not from New Jersey. So, I got a new idea. How about we elect a Jersey guy? How about we look at the general have been here for a 100 years. My grandfather worked his way up out of a ditch and became a very successful independent contractor. My dad and my mom were very successful restaurant bar owners in Somerset County. I followed in their footsteps as a two-time business owner. I've also had the privilege of serving at every level of government. Two terms at the municipal level where my grandparents immigrated. Two terms at the commissioner in SA County. Three two-year terms in purgatory, otherwise known as the New Jersey General Assembly. I've term limited myself every single time. Something else my opponent is lying about. But as an NBA CPA and a two-time business owner from a family that's been here for 100 years that served at every level, no gubernatorial candid has ever come before you with that kind of experience and background. And I'm going to leverage it to fix the state that we all love. So, I'm all in, guys. 9/6/2025 FULL CC We're going to continue to talk about the various crisis we have in New Jersey.

    "transcript_text": "Sep 7 - Sherrill appearance on Hopium radio Host: Simon Rosenberg Welcome, Congresswoman. Thanks so much for having me. I really appreciate it. Listen, we had you on a few months ago. Our community got behind you in the race. We've raised about 65,000 bucks. We got more to do, everybody. Right. This is one of the two must-win races for us this uh this November. Can you just give us an update on things? I know new issues have emerged. You've just launched a new ad. I mean, the campaign is now we're in the final stretch. Ads are flying, right? We got a real race. Just give us an update and tell us how you think you're doing. Um well, I'm thrilled to be here. I have to say, uh this has been a race like no other in the country. Um so, we have been running hard since last November. That's when I entered this and it has been a sprint. Um, and we had six people in the Democratic primary. Now we're fighting a really tough battle against someone who came within three points in the last election cycle against my current governor. And um, what that means is I've been talking to thousands of people across New Jersey in a way that almost no one else in the nation is doing right now. So it's fascinating because I hear from across the country people are they don't know what the messaging is. They don't know what's going on. They don't know where Democratic leadership is. That's not happening in New Jersey. Um, we have so many great leaders here. We are all coming together around supporting the people of New Jersey against these economic attacks from Donald Trump, a five billion dollar hit to our state's economy, tariff prices, raising costs on everybody across the state, putting small businesses out of business, and raising energy costs with uh one big beautiful bill that's been so harmful here. Um, also we see so many people that want to deliver better government for the people of New Jersey. Cutting through red tape and permitting, driving down housing costs, driving down utility costs. On day one, I'm declaring a state of emergency on these energy utility costs, which have gone up here by 20% last month. So, that is really critical if we are going to make sure families can thrive here in the Garden State. So, that's what I'm fighting for. And it um how's it going? It's uh it's exhausting. I ran down to Washington DC last night because as many people on your show probably know, they were trying to censure a member of my delegation, Lam Monica Maccgyver, for simply doing her oversight duties recently. Um and so I wanted to make sure that that that failed, which luckily it did. And uh so I got back about two in the morning. I was up early because it's my son's first day of school. And even though he's in high school, I you know, you still as a mom want to be there. So we did that. And then um and then I dropped him off. I screamed out the window that I loved him just to embarrass him. So that was that's a no no. That's a big no no. I know. He's trying to be so cool. Right. You broke you you broke the code. You broke the code. Yeah. Well, it you know what we said in the Navy, that which does not kill you makes you stronger. So there he goes. Um, but nevertheless, we're really, really running incredibly hard to get in front of the thousands and thousands of people to make the case about how here in New Jersey, we can do better. We can do better than what we're seeing from Washington and we can make sure that we're creating success here. And I'll say for all of your viewers who are outside the wonderful Garden State, um, this is setting the table for what we have to do going forward. the the focus we have on costs and accountability and our kids and the push back against Trump and the chaos and the tariffs and the price and the raising, you know, raising costs everywhere that I think is going to be the key path forward if Democrats are really going to serve people and deliver for the American people. And so this race is setting the table for what we can achieve in 2026 and beyond. You know, it's interesting the way you've put all that together because we've interviewed a lot of other candidates who are on the ground running right now, Roy Cooper in uh in North Carolina, and we had, you know, your good friend Abigail Spanberger on a few weeks ago. And it is consistent with what you said that the people who are on the ground running, not the people who are in DC trying to legislate and govern are much are hearing from their voters a lot about costs and affordability and price increases and health care getting out of reach and the fear I think increasingly as the ACA you know premium spikes come or the fear that are going to come around the ability to afford health care. I mean, these very kind of basic things that the Republicans are really on the wrong side of in a really profound way. I mean, you raised this issue. You've had utility costs go up, but they're going to keep going up further, right, because of the energy policy of this administration. And so, I I think that you're my assessment from listening to you is that you're right that this is sort of where we're going to be, you know, over the next year because it's where the voters are and we have to own that space as Democrats and that's what this race can do. So, as we defeat Trumpism in New Jersey in 2025, this is a really huge opportunity for the Democratic party. And I'll tell you why. Because we've been slipping here. So, in other words, my opponent, this is the third time he's running. Um, and he has tied himself so closely to Donald Trump. He said he can think of nothing he disagrees with Trump on. He said that it's his job to support the president. He said that the people of New Jersey have to experience pain u for Donald Trump's tariffs. So he has just wetted himself to the Trump agenda and to mega republicanism and he came within three points of my governor in his the last time he ran. Three points that was completely unforeseen and then New Jersey slid to the right by 10 points in 2024 in our last election. So this race could reverse that trend which will be a huge shot across the bow of the MAGA agenda that will really undermine the work that they are doing to coales the support across the country for that agenda. It will show that the people of America are not happy with it and it'll put wind in the sales of all of our Democratic candidates who will be running next year. every member of the House of Representatives, a third of the Senate, uh over 30 governors across the nation, this race can really give them a head start as they go into their cycle next year. Well, and talk, you just launched a new ad um about um about the utility crisis in New Jersey. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, so I I launched a new ad. I'm a former Navy helicopter pilot, so I went up in a helicopter, which uh was fun. So, I enjoyed I usually don't enjoy shooting commercials. That one I loved. Um, so we we went up just to kind of uh, you know, show that background and that, you know, kind of what we laid out was what we always say in the Navy, find a way or make one. So, kind of no more excuses. No more it's too hard or we can't move fast because I think people, as much as we hate what he's done, people have seen Donald Trump moving fast and really um, upending different systems. So, we have to do that in a way that really supports people, not anyone with the last name Trump, which seems to be how he's moving money. Um, so really fighting hard for people and moving quickly and driving costs down. So, the new ad lays out how I'm declaring a state of emergency on utility costs here, freezing rate hikes to support families, having that focus on our families, and it stands in in sharp contrast because, as you said, the ads are flying. So, this post Labor Day, we have ballots going out September 20th. So, it's right around the corner. And so, as you've said, uh the ads are flying. So, Jack Chidarelli, my opponent, has his ad up and it's just it's the same old same old, right? Like I said, this is the third time he's running. I think he first got into office when I was a sophomore in high school. Um he's just this kind of, you know, say whatever you want to hear type politician who's now 100% MAGA because that's which way he thinks the wind's blowing, I guess. But um always been extreme, always abortion bans, raising taxes, that kind of stuff. So he's got this ad. He's in a diner. Now I do stuff in diners all the time. I love diners, but I'm a little bit like, okay, sure. Because we saw a hundred of these, you know, already in this race. So he's there and he's, you know, acting like he's just some, you know, nice guy. He's running around and he says um that he just he's trying to rerun the 2024 election. And so he's saying, \"Oh, you know, Mikey Cheryl's talking about all she wants to do is talk about uh Trump and uh she has her woke agenda and she's these it's just and it's, you know, I'm watching this and I'm like, the only person talking in their ad right now, and I'm not saying we won't, you know, but the ads we just put out, the only person talking about Trump is is Jack Chidarelli, right? And then this whole woke agenda thing, I mean, I don't know. Nobody in New Jersey wants to attack vulnerable people. So we're happy to protect vulnerable people. We just also have to then focus on running government really really well to also protect families across the state who are very vulnerable because of Trump. So you know his lack of a economic message and his desire to just go into these kind of um attacks on you know whoever he thinks is the least popular person right now that he can get away with attacking. It's just it's just not what New Jerseyians want to see right now. Listen, it's one of the reasons they're scrambling around to steal those seats and Trump is talking about rigging the elections next year. You know, they're rebranding the big ugly bill, right? Is because they can't run on the current agenda that they have. And you know, the same thing is happening as you know in Virginia, right? They're running the 2024 playbook. her, you know, Abigail Spanberger's opponent just dropped a new ad that could have been cut in September of 2024 because 2025 is ugly for them. you know, they've been, you know, getting that we've been beating them in all these specials and these local elections all across the country and they don't, to your point, they don't have an easy and obvious place to go now because your opponent is for raising prices on people and he's for higher utility costs and he's for worse health care for everybody and and and and right. And so where do they go on things that are actually attractive to people? And so it sounds like, you know, it's it's interesting how you I think you've hit on something really important is that this is a reason why that they're that Mike Johnson and all the Washington Republicans are really worried about what's happening in our politics. Trump's numbers are down. They're struggling. We continue to overperform and kick ass. We've got great candidates like you, right? We've had a tremendous cycle of great candidates emerge. And so I think there we should be optimistic about what we can do. I mean, what I talk about at Hopium is that our community's goal should be to win the fall. We want to win the fall. We want to win these elections. We want to beat the Republicans in the budget battle that's coming up. And, you know, and do and take what we need in that in that important fight that's coming because you're right, we're with the people and, you know, they're with Trump and the oligarchs. And so, we're in very strong pos. I've been feeling this with other candidates we've been interviewing that Democrats feel strong right now. they feel grounded, you know, in these races. And it's been very reassuring to me because that's not always been the case when I've been interviewing people, you know, in races over the many years I've been doing this. And so, it's great to hear, you know, that you're feeling like, you know, you can get this done. Thank you so much. Yeah, I I have to tell you, um there's nothing better than when you're running and you know what has to be done to deliver better for families and your message to people is connecting because you know you're hitting on all the right notes. You know, you have identified after speaking to thousands of people across the state exactly what it is that you can do to make people's lives better. and then you're running a campaign on it and connecting with people and that gives you this sense that and when I get into office we're going to take these on right away and start delivering that is a great I mean that's why so many of us are in public office right and you put it so well because I can guarantee you that Jack Chedarelli does not have that feeling because he has nothing to run on his party is fractured he's connected himself to Trump there is nothing he wants to do that is going to connect with families or make their lives better. And so running a c a hollow a really hollow campaign like that um is never anything I've wanted to do or done. And so to see him try to try to do it I I'm so happy to see that it doesn't seem like it's connecting. Now we've got a lot of work ahead of us because um I want to thank you for all the work you've done to raise money for this campaign. This, as I've laid out, I think is the most important campaign in the nation um for how we set the table for next year, just because we have been running so long and have so much connection to people and I think have narrowed in on that message that is going to be powerful and set the table, but it only matters if we can get the word out. And so we have the most expensive media market in the nation in New York for the top half of our state and then the bottom half is the third most expensive media market in Philadelphia. So the the bar is really high here to get that message out. We saw when we did it our early polls in the primary were so were really good. People have sort of slipped back to that generic ballot right now. Now we're back up on air. And the more we can get the word out on what is going on and our agenda and our plan, the better we will do and the better the Democratic Party will do. So, I just want to thank everybody. I'll remind you my website is mikeysher.com. Um, please go there. Even if it's just a couple bucks, all of that helps us get the word out and I think really helps us drive the message that's going to be very compelling, not just for this year, but for the years to come.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 11 - Jack call with 1210 Talk Radio is we're getting closer and closer to election day in New Jersey and I like the momentum. I like the energy. I was with Jack Chidarelli last week and he's got the uh the eye of the tiger, the fire in his eyes, no doubt about it. And he joins us now here on Talk Radio 1210 WPHD. Jack, how are you my man? >> Hey Rich, great to be back with you. Thanks for the opportunity. >> Absolutely great to have you. Uh I know it's a busy day for you. Um, I I'll give you the floor first of all if you want to comment on Charlie Kirk, uh, 911, uh, whatever you want to say to start the interview. >> We're going to miss him. Uh, Rich, and everyone is heartbroken over this. You know, it was Charlie that said once that when the public discourse ends, the violence begins. And so, this was a man of great faith, a man of great conviction, but also very respectful in his approach. And, um, it's just heartbreaking news. And um I think everyone's going to feel a whole lot better once the murderers are are uh in custody and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. >> Well said, Jack. Well said. Um also, obviously, today being the 24th anniversary or remembrance of 9/11, um you know, as governor of New Jersey and and knock on wood, you'll get there, uh there's going to have to be a lot at stake here, uh as we go into the 25th remembrance of 911 next year, and hopefully you'll be at the helm for that. what what lessons have we learned and and and what what do you think is really crucial as governor um as as we go forward here? >> You know, Rich, whenever I've had the privilege of speaking at a 9/11 uh ceremony um honoring the lives of all those we lost that day, um I know it's a day of remembrance and it should never not be. Uh we lost 3,000 of our fellow Americans that day and close to 500 of them were first responders. But I've also always asked uh those who've been there to listen that we should also use it as a day of of uh teaching of the destruction of hate. And we saw that again yesterday with with Charlie Kirk. And so let's not only use it as a day of remembrance uh but let's teach the next generation and everyone thereafter that hate is destructive and that we need better tolerance uh even for those who we disagree with. Um, and so again, I always think of this day as not just a day of remembrance, but a day of for people. >> Yeah, well said, Jack. Well said. Uh, a friend of mine got a mailer the other day. It was meant for her college daughter who's a registered Republican, which is bizarre. Uh, and it was sent and the entire ad was nothing but you and Donald Trump. There was no message from Mikey Cheryl about what she would do as governor. Uh, there was nothing about her ideas. It was just simply uh Jack Chidarelli and Donald Trump. That was the entire ad. Uh boy, that to me in the early part of September just screams desperation, Jack. >> It is a desperate campaign in every way. She's lying left and right about my positions on various things. She's put out a terrible thing that uh we've called for a cease and desist order on with regard to this 10% sales tax. But listen, I take it as a compliment. It says we're winning. Uh Rich, uh but listen, shame on her. She often likes to talk about her service in the Navy. The uh the code of honor for Midshipman is that Mitch Shipman will always tell the truth and never lie. I think she's forgotten that code of honor. >> Yeah, I think so, too. This lie about uh the 10% sales tax that you've now told her cease and desist on, it's a blatant lie. We we we've I've heard the audio. It's hard to play on the air, but she's absolutely 100% lying about this and distorting what you said. Um, and it's shameful, but it also shows you that when you have nothing else and you have no vision and you have no real policy to run on, lie about your opponent and then try to distract everybody by talking about the president because who's not, by the way, running for governor, >> right? And right now, when she's not lying, suddenly she's starting to reverse her position. I mean, when she was in the Congress, she voted to get rid of qualified immunity, which is critical to the law enforcement community. it was provides them the protection to go out and do the most dangerous of all jobs each and every day. And now suddenly she's saying no no I'm for qualified immunity. Um we've seen this now with her energy policy. Suddenly now she's embracing natural gas and nuclear after embracing wind for the last 8 years which has been a total failure in New Jersey. So I mean these are the signs of a desperate campaign uh on behalf of a desperate candidate. But we're just going to continue to go out there each and every day talk about how it is we're gonna fix New Jersey. Good. So, let's talk about how Jack Chidarelli is going to fix New Jersey. And I know the the the number one thing right now on everybody's mind is energy. Mikey Cheryl is lying by saying that she can freeze energy rates. First of all, I don't know why you'd want to freeze them at at these prices because they're, you know, they're off the charts thanks to the uh energy policies of Murphy. But number two, she can't freeze them. That's an absolute lie. But what can we do, Jack? >> And it is an absolute lie. even the governor slapped her down on it um saying, you know, I don't think you can do that. Here's what I do on day one, and I can do this by executive order. Rich, I pull this out of Reggie. The regional greenhouse gas initiative has been a failure. Air's no cleaner. Electricity is only more expensive, and I'm not going to have rateayer dollars go to other states to improve their grid. That saves us in rateayer charges a half a billion dollars a year. That's for homeowners, tenants, businesses across the board. And then what I got to do is double down reopening those plants that Phil Murphy closed down, repurposing them for natural gas and expanding our nuclear footprint in South Jersey. I'll even accelerate solar on commercial rooftops. When you think about all the warehouses that have gone up, that is fertile ground or rooftop if you will for solar arrays. So those are all things we can do on day one to once again produce more electricity than we need. Start being electricity exporter again instead of an importer. >> That'd be nice. That'd be really really nice. Absolutely. No doubt about that. Um, and the other thing too that I think everybody needs to understand is that as much as Mikey Sher is lying about all this stuff right now, a bunch of Democrat governors got together and said they they want to move forward with these wind projects. Uh, as soon as she gets in there, she's going to embrace that. Absolutely. >> Well, she's not from New Jersey, so she doesn't realize how srosank the jersey sure is. And we've seen this with Corsine. He came here from Illinois. We saw this with Murphy. He came here from Massachusetts. My opponent's not from New Jersey. So, you know, Rich, as I go around the state, I like to have a little fun and saying, \"How about we elect a Jersey guy?\" >> Yeah. How about electing a Jersey guy for a change? I mean, amazing, right? Your family's been in the state now for what is it, 160 years? >> We've been here. And uh I'll tell you something else. As a two-time business owner, as an NBA CPA, I really believe what we need more than ever is someone that understands budgets, somebody that understands taxes, someone who controls spending, and and certainly someone who's going to be the hands-on CEO, governor that we need to leave this state. I mean, Murphy's been MIA. I don't think he's ever really checked in. The same thing goes for his administration. Is going to show up every day. You know, Rich, I want to show you how dysfunctional this state government is. In Florida, you can walk into a DMV office today, walk out an hour later with your real ID. In New Jersey, you call up DMV today for your real ID, they're giving you an appointment in December. >> That's ridiculous. Well, you said that they're still not back in the office, right? A lot of these state employees. >> Ah, please. We're bringing them back to work on day one. They work for us. Try getting somebody on the phone. Try getting your issue resolved. This is Phil Murphy's New Jersey. But at the end of the day, Rich, don't worry about your taxes. Don't worry about your electric bill. Don't worry about how we handcuffed your cops. Don't worry about how the public school system is failing your kids. We can all go home and smoke Phil Murphy's pot and we're all going to feel great. >> Jack Chinelli is with us, hopefully the next governor of New Jersey. Uh the effort uh to get out the vote. By the way, I want to mention something. Uh Sean Hannity the other night in Fox News, I love this, actually apologized to you for not giving your race enough attention in 2021. Takes a big man to admit what he's wrong and he was wrong and he did not. And now uh Fox News has been covering your race on on basically a daily basis right now, which is great. You've been on Fox and Friends a bunch and they've been following you at your various diner stops. That in of itself is a huge sign of how close this race really is. you posted about that and I appreciate that. But I appreciate what Sean did. It's the second time in three weeks he's had me on him both times. He said 2021 is on me. I paid no attention to New Jersey. I didn't give this guy a chance. He's the next governor of New Jersey. He's going to make it happen. And so I really appreciate him coming clean. But I will tell you, Rich, uh the country is paying attention this time around. And I appreciate the attention that New Jersey is getting. Often I'm asked on these interviews of what the national implications are for a win in New Jersey. And with all due respect, I get the question, but there's only one implication I'm worried about, Rich, and that's us not winning this race. We cannot afford another four years of Phil Murphy's failed policies. >> Uh kids are back in school, Jack. Uh today, a lot of us as parents, you know, I've got three kids, as you know, and and they're all young and they're all in school. Uh we're all worried about the future. We're all worried about the indoctrination in our schools. Um, what what can we do about it, Jack? Because I I'm I get worried that a governor, Mikey Cheryl, she said the other day, and the clip's gone viral now, I I've been making sure everybody hears it. I don't want I don't believe parents should have a say in their kids' education when it comes to certain different kinds of curriculum. >> It's another thing that I could change on day one. I do it first by replacing everybody on the state board of education. My state board of education will give us a curriculum that focuses on critical life skills, provides vocational training opportunities with an age appropriate curriculum that respects the rights of parents, and that includes getting rid of policy 5756. No longer will our school districts be keeping secrets from parents. That would all continue if there was Governor Cheryl. That ends on day one under Governor Chedarelli. >> Yeah. You asked me the other night when we were together, you said, \"Is the issue of uh of protecting women's sports an 8020 issue?\" Because that's what we like to say, 8020. And and really it's like 982. But um but that issue is is critical, too. And I I'm I'm telling you, there there are a lot of parents out there, you know, this that they won't post about it on social media, but they want to make sure that their little girls can compete in sports and compete fairly. And that is a crucial issue. And I believe these parents are going to vote Republican. They're going to vote for you this November. Just on that issue alone, Jack. I really do. >> I believe the same thing, Rich. Listen, we want an inclusive and welcome environment for everybody, but what we want most of all is a fair a fair environment. There's nothing fair about biological males playing in female sports. My opponent's a mother of two daughters, and she voted yes twice. Twice to allow biological males to play in female sports. Be one of the critical issues in the home stretch here. >> Twice she voted for that. >> Twice. >> Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Everybody needs to understand. >> And let's not forget she voted no on the Lake and Riley Act. I mean, let's let's let's look at this now. You came here illegally. Crime number one, and while you're here, you broke the law. Crime number two, we're not going to detain and deport you. She voted no. >> Yeah. So, let's talk about crime because it's it's obviously on on everybody's mind right now. Um, you had a a brutal slang of a of a that Ukrainian refugee in in in North Carolina. Um, we I I I again, this is an 8020 issue. I mean, people want safe streets. They black, white, Latino, everybody wants safe streets, Jack. Period. >> And my opponent has failed to acknowledge the fact that cashless bail has been a failure. We now have professional criminals who've learned how to game the system because of arrest, release, repeat. Ask any local cop about arrest, release, repeat. It's why we've got nonviolent crime through the roof in our communities here in New Jersey. And it's why what happened happened down in North Carolina with that terrible murder. He'd been arrested 14 times previously, Rich. >> Yeah. Yeah. I It's It's It's amazing. It really is. It And yet back on the streets and and he was schizophrenic, too. And there's and and the left, you know, they believe that it's compassion to just let people back on the streets. There's nothing compassionate about that. >> Well, there's two changes you get on day one of a Chedarella administration. Number one, okay, and this is by executive order. I get rid of the immigrant trust directive. What does that mean? No town in our state will be a sanctuary city. We will not be a sanctuary state. And the second thing we get to work on is reforming bail reform. It's been a failure. No more cashless bail. If people have broken the law, they're going to pay the consequences. We'll get them off the street. >> Last thing before I I let you go back to your diner tour because I I I love that you're doing that, by the way. I love that you're you're talking I I do. I think it's the greatest it's the greatest way to connect to people in New Jersey by talking to them in diners. It's something our state offers. >> Boulder is rich. >> It really is. There is >> no doubt and the polls are always wrong uh in in the states. So pay no attention to them. But what are you hearing from people when you go to these diners when you talk to them directly about taxes and and the issue that is most on mind when I talk to people which is affordable quote unquote affordable housing because I got to tell you not far from me a massive massive development going in. Everyone I know and people that I know that have always voted Democrat are very concerned about this and saying this is this has gone too far here. >> Rich, this is one of the most hypocritical positions of all of the supposedly pro- environment Democratic party. They're taking garden right out of the Garden State by allowing all this overdevelopment of highdensity housing in rural communities all across the state, all 564 towns. And the poster child for this is in Cranberry, New Jersey, where they've run out of space. They've got to meet their fourth round obligation of building affordable housing. And they're condemning the mayor and council there, the Democrats are condemning through eminent domain a 175year-old family farm to build up more highdensity housing. This is criminal and it stops on day one of my administration. >> All right, as we head into the fall, New Jersey has a lot of great things to offer for the fall, but please don't tell me Jack Shidelli is a pumpkin spice guy, cuz then this may be a dealbreaker. >> Uh, listen, I'm not going to break your heart. I'm not a pumpkin spice guy, Rich. I'm just not. Okay. >> All right. You already broke my heart on the sauce versus gravy debate and the uh the pizza with anchovies and no cheese. So, fine. Uh this gives me hope for the future. Uh follow Jack at Jack4nj. Get involved in his campaign. We can do this. We only need 80,000 more votes. And this man is the next governor of New Jersey. And he brings with him a Republican legislature. So, let's get this done. and Jack, I know you'll be on the show a bunch of times between now and November, but thanks my friend. Enjoy the rest of your day. I appreciate it. >> Hey, hey, Rich. I'll end it with this. We just came out of the field in three days of polling. Guess what? Dead heat. So looking forward next time. >> Dead heat, baby. I love that. Means that means Jack's really up by five, but we're not gonna take it for granted. So dead heat. Let's go do this. We can do it. >> All right, buddy. Thank you. Thank you, Jack.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 13 - Sherrill speech in Phillipsburg Thank you. Wow. Thank you guys so much. I really appreciate it. Thank you for coming out this morning uh in such an important race at such an important time. You know, I often think about um all that's going on in the country and and all of the things that we are working to address. And I tell you, as somebody who served in the Navy for almost 10 years, as a mom, as someone who's always fought for our country, I I think we're in some really, really troubling times. But I also know that if we stick together, if we have our mission, if we fight hard for the people we love, we're going to prevail. And I I'll tell you this because I often think about what it meant to serve. And in the Navy, we had servant leadership. Meaning that when you were in a leadership role, it wasn't about you. We often said ship shipmate self because you kind of came last on that list. The people that came first are the people that you were serving. The people that were overseas and so if something happened to their family, it was up to you to make sure they were okay. if their kid got sick, if their spouse wasn't able to pay their bills because their pay got screwed up, if there was a problem with their parents, it was up to you to make sure things were okay because you were in a leadership role. And I think about that a lot right now because that's what we're demanding of leaders. leaders who are going to put people first, not themselves, not trying to enrich their kids to the tune of billions of dollars, but the people of New Jersey. And I think this stands in such a sharp contrast to my opponent, Jack Titerelli.  The universe agrees. The universe agrees because every turn he has put Trump first. He said he can't think of one way in which he disagrees with Donald Trump. Not one way. Wrong for New Jersey. Wrong for New Jersey. And guess what? We could help him out with this. I got a list. I can tell you I disagree with the fact that these tariffs are closing small businesses across our state and driving up costs everywhere. I disagree with the fact that Trump's budget bill is going to harm the one in three kids who use Medicaid to get their health health insurance, the seniors in nursing homes. It's going to make all of our colleges and universities more expensive as they're clawing money out of research and funding for them. So again and again and again the Trump administration is raising prices on all of us and Jack Chidarelli's right there supporting it. In fact, his response to the tariffs that are raising costs on everyone was, \"Well, people in New Jersey need to experience a little pain in support of Donald Trump. Why? Why? Not on my watch. I'm going to fight that tooth and nail.\" Yeah.  And not only am I going to fight back against what's coming from Washington and raising your costs everywhere, but I'm going to fight for you in Trenton. Making sure on day one I'm declaring a state of emergency on utility cost, raising your rates, fighting hard for transparency and accountability so you know where your tax dollars are going. putting a report card up online so you can see are we getting what we're paying for from the contracts we're putting out who has those contracts. You're going to be able to tell as a citizen here in this state and then fighting hard to cut through the red tape that's raising costs on everybody. So, when you're trying to open a small business and you can't get through the permitting fee and you keep paying hundreds of dollars each time you go back in person because it's not online to try to get your business permitted, making sure that we are fighting hard to drive down cost of apartment rentals and mortgage companies and taking on people who are colluding colluding to drive all of them up. At every turn, I'm going to be fighting for you. Thank you. That's the kind of leader I'm going to be.  And in that way, we're going to fight hard to drive a different vision forward here. Because I'm a mom of four kids. And I got to tell you, I'm not just fighting for myself. I'm fighting for them. I'm fighting for your kids. I'm fighting for your grandkids. I'm fighting for the future. Because here in New Jersey, we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to lead the way on taking care of our kids, driving down our cost, providing an accountable government again and again and again, fighting for the things that all of us know New Jersey can be. So, thank you all so much. I really appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Nice t-shirt. Uh, raing all you guys. And I hope you have a fantastic day. Thank you.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 16 - Ciattarelli speech Elizabeth, New Hope Church Pastor Miles, it's not too late for you to be in the governor's race. I'll step down if you want to get in. Thank you. And many thanks to all of you for welcoming and I and my team. Warm welcome. First day of the house. Thank you. Got to know them a little better today and not our first time together, but we got to know each other a little better. Met your grandchildren. Yes. And uh I've come to learn that his grandchildren do not call him grandpa. No, they do not call him Poppy. They call him Big Daddy. And I was thinking when we win this race, I kind of like that better than Governor Big Daddy. And we know we're going to win this race. And if I didn't believe that, I should be running for governor. Let me tell you why I think we're going to win. This campaign is marked by something I believe very strongly, and I felt it here today at your house of worship. Positive energy. Our message is about united, not divided. And our message about people, not power or politics. And this is the most diverse state in the country. And I believe there's power and beauty in that diversity if we embrace it. And we will under my governorhip. The music we've heard today is beautiful. And I'm not just talking about the voices. Talking about the actual musicians. You notice on sure the musicians are not all one race of color. They're diverse, but yet in working together, they've produced the most beautiful sound. The question I'm asked most often is, why are you running for governor? 100 years ago, my grandparents came to this country and uh settled in Rarington Burough in Somerset County. My grandfather started as a laborer in the ditch for the water company. Same as nickels and dimes at what was a very very difficult time for Italians uh here in this country and um became a very successful independent contractor. That was in the 30s, 40s and 50s. My parents, my dad did not have a high school diploma. My dad worked 38 years in the street department for public service gas distribution. My mother worked midnights on the line for J&J. There were about 10 years in the 60s and 70s where they owned a restaurant in Somerset County. My mom worked midnights. She ran the restaurant bar by day. My dad worked by day. He ran the restaurant bar by night. And every dime they made went to their four children. The roof over our head. It was a pretty modest home. Four children. My parents and six of us. One bathroom. I have four kids and five bathrooms. And I heard arguments over the bathroom. We never argued in my house about the bathroom. But um every time my parents made with their four children, roof over our head, meal on the table, clothes on your back, and our public education, and you had me home at 5 for dinner. My parents remind us every day of our responsibilities to each other, our faith, our community, our state, our country, and told us never to expect anything in return other than fulfilling the American promise of opportunity. That it was up to us to take advantage of the American opportunity. My parents also told us in that house, our sport children, that we didn't have any rights. No rights. We had responsibilities. We all got one right at the age of 18. If we were no longer cooperating, it was the right to move out. They made that quite clear. I followed in my grandparents and parents' footsteps um after being at Satan Hall University for my undergraduate degree and my graduate degree. I'm an NBA CPA. Didn't even leave the state to go to college. and I'm a two-time successful business owner having created jobs right here in New Jersey. What am I getting at? The answer to the question I'm most often asked, why are you running for governor? Three generations of generally achieved their American dream right here in New Jersey. And I'm running for governor because I want to make sure today's New Jerseyians and future generations of generans rather can achieve the American dream right here in New Jersey. Unfortunately, today one out of two people feel the state is headed in the wrong direction. Two out of three are looking to leave. And people no longer have confidence whether or not this is a state in which they can get the education of their dreams, the job of their dreams, raise a family here, start a business here, retire here. These are things that people feel terribly insecure, if not fearful of today. I do not want to be the governor of a state where one out of two people think we're headed in the wrong direction. I don't want to be a governor of a state where two out of three people are looking to leave. I don't want to be a governor state where people live in fear. I believe leadership matters. I believe we can fix what's broken here in New Jersey. And if I didn't think it would be fixed, I would not be wasting your time or asking for the privilege to be your governor. When something I love is broken, I won't fix it. The state of New Jersey is broken in a number of different ways. And you know what they are. We're up against them every single day. And so, particularly in our urban areas, the day we have to fix on day one, and we will in my administration, is our educational system. When I say that one thing the two things that everybody wants are opportunity and security. The opportunity comes in the form of educational opportunity and economic opportunity. And then you gain security if you're able to take advantage of the equal educational opportunity and equal economic opportunity. Education. We know in many of our schools around the state, we have eighth graders that are not on grade level for reading, writing, math. I'm a data guy. The data is pretty clear. If you leave A3 not on grade level for reading, writing, math, you will be undermployed your entire life. New Jersey recently slipped from 2 to 12 on the national report card because we haven't recovered from all the learning loss during the pandemic. Louisiana moved from 48 to 32, putting in place something I've called for for a long time, a high impact curriculum. If your child is not on grade level for reading, writing, math, we're going to extend neck tire next period, next mark period, or the market period after that, the market period after that, getting them on grade level for those critical life skills. I also want to provide more vocational training opportunities for our students because not all kids want or need to go to college. This is very personal for me. Of my four children, one of which went into the trades, he does very, very well as a licensed diesel mechanic. But I will tell you, in our high school where we were raised, my son Anthony was treated like a secondass citizen because he wasn't going to college. That's not fair. That's not fair. And I tease high school principles at times when I say to them, just once I want to come to a high school graduation and there are two valid Victorians. The kid that's going to the league tomorrow and the kid that's starting tomorrow is a $50,000 electrician. Why don't we celebrate that student? So, we got to get back to the basics. I promise you that as we go around the state of New Jersey, okay, everyone will be included. Everyone will have a seat at the table. The pastor has my number. I will answer his call. And if I can't, I will return that call. I'm going to reinvigorate, because it's kind of gone dormant, the governor's interfaith council. The interfaith council is comprised of religious leaders from all the various states all throughout New Jersey to meet each month with the governor and by working together strengthen our communities. How can we work together to strengthen our communities? I think it's our communities of faith that need to lead the way in healing our communities and they do need to be healed. Those are just some of the things that we can do on day one. Improve our educational system, strengthen our communities by having a more open dialogue and a more inclusive state government. There was a study done recently sponsored by the African-American Chamber of Commerce that showed that there is a terrible disparity in our state government in terms of the number of state contracts that minority business entities get. They're not getting enough. And I follow very very closely what Mayor Adams has done in New York City. He has put in place a new process to ensure that minority owned businesses get their fair share of state contracts. This is critically important. For many minority owned businesses, public contracts at the municipal, county, and state level are the first entree to taking their business to a whole another level. We know even here in New Jersey, we are not adhering to the commercial lending act that says our community banks are supposed to loan out money to minority communities. These are all the things that have lapsed during the current last 8 years of the current administration. Those are things that will change on day one of my administration. Also, my administration, my cabinet will reflect New Jersey's diversity because I think that's the right thing to do. As governor, I will visit at least two houses of worship every month and through the power of social media show where it is that I'm sharing worship with all the various states of our state. It's another way to bring us together. But most importantly, I think my job as a candidate and my job as governor is to listen. I can't possibly be an expert in all things. I'm a CPA. I'm a two-time business owner. I think of myself as a CEO, not a politician. But know this. Yes, I've owned two of my own businesses in the state, but I've also had the privilege of serving in every level of government. When I came home from St. Paul University, the mayor at the time recruited me to run in my own hometown and I was a council president. Two terms. I've always determined myself. I served two terms and I moved on. 10 years later, I was asked to run for county commissioner in some county. I served two terms and then I moved on. And then they asked me to run for state legislature and I served three two-year terms. And after seeing Trenton from the inside out, I said to myself, I'm only coming back under one condition, and that's to be your governor and really effectuate the change we so desperately need here in New Jersey. And I came very, very close in 2021. I'm still in therapy. Just joking. I said that the other day and there was a woman said in the front, \"Ros sorry.\" The men never say, \"I'm sorry. It's just the women.\" No, you just got to do it. But I do believe we're going to win this time around. But the point I was trying to make about my public service, no candidate's ever come before you whose family has been here for 100 years, who has an NBA CPA, who's a two-time business owner, and has served at every level of government. But know this about my public service. Other than the fact that I turned myself and didn't take the pay or the benefits, I wanted a town, a county, and a legislative district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans sometimes very significantly. I'm proud of that. And I think the reason is because as a Republican, I've always gone places other Republicans don't or won't. If you're welcome. If you're welcome. And what I've always thought about is how to solve our problems. I'm not a hyperartisan. I'm not rigid in my ideology. And having raised four children, what I've kind of learned is at times the world is shades of gray. Rarely isn't black and white. It's shades of gray. And we have to adapt to get things done. Uh but I'm proud of the fact that I've won those seven races in districts in the county and town, Democrats, out Republicans going out talking about the issues and what my ideas are to solve those problems. And those seven victories always time and time again restored my faith in people that at the end of the day when people go into that voting booth they close the curtain behind them and they vote for the person not the party. They vote their conscience and that shows the goodness of people. Someone has said to me recently I can't think of a worse time to be governor with the various crisis we face across the state. Quite frankly, I couldn't think of a better time to be governor. The crisis reside provides an opportunity for us to hit the reset button. And I'm not going to do that on behalf of all 9.3 million New Jerseyians. Couple things I want you to know about me and the pastor if it's okay. We can open up the floor. People want to ask questions. Yeah, we have questions. Excellent. Know this about me. Unlike governors on both sides of the aisle over the last 40 years, I'm not using this as a stepping stone to get to Washington DC. I've been asked to run for Congress. The answer's been no. It will continue to be. I've been asked to run for Senate. The answer's been no. It continues to be. The pastor has not asked to run for president yet, but the answer is no. And I don't want to write a book. I just want to write the ship. So, you don't need to worry about me getting distracted because I've got ambitions to go to Washington DC. I don't. The Cheryl have all been very, very fortunate because of our hard work. And what I'm trying to say with the utmost humility is I don't need a job. And on your behalf, our behalf, make no mistake, I want the job. This is home. Always has been, always will be. And if you decide to send me home in four or eight years, I'm going to the beach in S City. I'll still be right here in Jersey, but I'm not going anywhere else. And the other thing is, I'm not owned by any special interests. Once your governor is owned by the special interests, they're compromised. And once they're compromised, they cannot get the job done. It's no different than a compromised soul. Once you're compromised, it's over. I'm not owned by any special interest mess. And I promise you that we'll do right by all the people of New Jersey. So, Pastor Dad, I'm happy to answer questions.   Two things Jack and I have in common. I did not uh get a high school diploma either like I was kicked out of every school in the winter and get my GED from college. Uh and then I also used to work for Johnson Johnson 10 years. Uh and so mom and dad those are good parents. Uh I've had an opportunity those of you that are members of my church be involved with several governors. you know, uh, Phil Murphy, Governor Murphy first, uh, looked at the, uh, opportunity to run for governor, uh, they reached out to me. I took him to meet our leader in Al Shark, National Action Network, uh, Corsa, uh, Christy, I can go all the way back to Christy Todd Whitney, uh, who gave me my first startup money for a nonprofit organization. So, this is not my first rodeo. Uh, I've been involved with this uh since God gave me another chance. Uh, I've been in prison more times than my age. Uh, and I took everything that I did and turned it around. Uh, the same people that uh, used to lock me up now they call me for advice. And so I know it can work because I made a decision, Pastor Mouse, to do better. Uh, and I think all of us really really need to think about how we can do better. Uh, I'm honored that he's here today. Uh, I did, for for the record, I did uh receive a call from Mikey Sher. She did reach out to me after uh I had posted that Jack was coming to my church. Uh, but those of you that know Reverend Al Sharpton, the National Action Network know that we do not endorse candidates, but we do grade them. And I have already started the grading process uh and the report after I talked to Rachel Noringer to get her grade and Re Sharpton, we will be giving out a grade regarding who we think uh that we ought to be looking for to be our next governor. I think Jack is on the right road honesty. We have a million group over there. my daughters and them, they are really uh concerned. I know Pastor um Jeffrey Powell raised some concerns about uh pregnancy, chick daycare centers. Uh I also have a daycare center. Uh I also have a technology center, 30,000 square ft. uh in the city of North Atlantic City, Jersey City where I partner with one of the biggest developers uh move former baseball player from Boston Red Sox of America. Uh we do after school programs throughout the state of New Jersey and in Brooklyn, New York. I came up with something, Jack, that was really dear to me. I remember when I was coming up, they used to have the book mobile. Uh but we have a technology mobile. Uh but we go into all underprivileged areas where kids that don't have access to internet take up and get on the bus uh and do their after school homework and things of that nature. I've also been given an opportunity to work with former governor, Lieutenant Governor Sher Oliver, nephew. Can we give Charles Oliver a hand?  Sister Karen and Ray have questions. Uh, I want to ask Karen and Ray to stand if we have questions for Jack. I didn't want everybody to stand up and ask a whole bunch of questions, but just wanted some decency and order. So, she's going to come. I want y'all to come. Want to come. Come on. Calm. and then want to ask uh some of the questions that some of you wrote down uh to uh yeah all right well welcome to great to be here we're very glad I know it is my first time but it's not being my last you're always welcome I made that sense so we have a few questions for you many residents say New Jersey is becoming unaffordable between property taxes, housing, utilities, and healthcare. What specific policies will you enact to make everyday life more affordable for middle and low income? So, the word I like most in that question is specific because one of my great liabilities is I'm going to give you specifics and we do have affordability crisis across the state. No matter where I go right now, the one aspect of our affordability crisis that everyone asks me about first and foremost is their electric bill. And so what we're going to do on day one is pull out of the regional greenhouse gas initiative, which is carbon tax. Our air is no cleaner after being in this plan for 8 years. Our electricity is only more expensive and rateayer dollars going to other states. By pulling out the regional greenhouse gas initiative, we can save about half a billion dollars a year for rateayers. So I can lower your electricity bill on day one and uh so that's something we can do. Uh number two, um we hear that uh the affordability crisis is most acute for our seniors. So one thing I want to do across the state of New Jersey is freeze property taxes for everyone once they hit age 70. Property taxes frozen for life once you hit age 70. Number two, make number three make all retirement income taxree in Pennsylvania. All retirement income is tax-free. Not in New Jersey. This would be something else to give our seniors some degree of certainty that they can afford their expenses as they move through the latter stages of their life. We also hear that this is most acute for our young people. And so two of the things in my platform is your first two years out of high school or your first two years out of college will be taxfree. Knowing the tax in the first two years start and next thing that I have my platform is for firsttime home buyers. And I hope that we'll get to the issue of housing cuz it's a critical critical critically important issue. But the first 5 years of home ownership for first-time home buyers, your property tax will be capped at 1% of the assessed value of the home. Let me give you an example to make my point. My daughter recently got married. She's 30 and uh her husband just bought their first home and um it's $600,000. What's some dumb debt? I understand. I I know you understand. We have another thing in common. Um the property taxes will be capped under my plan at $6,000 for the first five years instead of the $17,000 they have to pay to help them get going. Yeah. Help them get going. Right. These are some of the things we also need. More affordable housing or what's sometimes referred to as workforce housing. And I see that particularly in our urban centers. And so as governor, I'm going to do everything in my power to work in partnership with developers, faith-based organizations to provide more affordable housing. But I want to be clear about something. All the affordable housing has been built in the last 5 8 years. Everyone's renting in this country. We build equity through home ownership. We build wealth through business ownership. And so I don't want to see affordable housing strictly be rental agreements. I'd rather see them be ownership outright or lease to own lease to own so people can own their unit and start to build that equity. But I will say we're going to have a very candid discussion what concerns me very greatly particularly in the black community. If this is a country in which you build equity through home ownership and wealth through business ownership, I'm seeing other first generation Americans, whether it's in the Latino community or the Asian community, pass the black community by when it comes to home ownership and business ownership. And we have to fix that. And I'm convinced in working in partnership that we can fix that. We can put programs in place, commercial, the commercial lending act. Banks are not fulfilling their obligation to make loans in our minority communities. And I promise you, under my administration, my commissioner bank insurance will ensure that banks are adhering to the commercial lending act. I'm a I'm a real estate broker and a developer in this community. So, I'm listening very carefully and I'm going to be reaching out to you to uh follow up on some of these policies. I'm going to be selfish for a second since you're real. We're getting rid of mansion tax on day one of administration. That makes real estate more expensive. And by the way, mansion is a misleading term. We know homes have gotten very expensive. I mean, my daughter's first know that cost. Um, second, I don't think you should ever reassess a home if somebody does a home improvement. Amen. Why are we reassessing your home when you've done a home improvement? Okay. Now, you know, in Chennerelli's in Hillsboro house recently, uh we had a 25-year-old bathroom and we generated revenue for the town by paying for the permits. We we spurred the economy with a $25,000 investment redoing on bathroom. And the day after I got the CO, the front doorbell rings and uh in walked the uh tax assessor. And uh she said to me, \"You know what I have to do?\" I said, \"Yes.\" I said, \"Let me ask you something. Over the course of 25 years, we were beating the hell out of the bathroom. Did the assessment go down?\" She said, \"Oh, no, no, no. It doesn't work that way.\" I said, \"I know it doesn't work that way.\" They reassess the home. That's right. Okay. That's not right. So, the governor said, \"We're not going to reassess the home just because you have a home approved.\" Amen.  Okay. Mr. This is question is in two parts. New Jersey's curriculum is hypersexualized starting in kindergarten. What can you what can you do to protect parents rights? Uh what can you do to protect par parental rights to opt their children out of those lessons? That's number one. And number two is is it true that schools can refer parents to DIY if the parents do not affirm their child's desire to be part of an LGBT plus community? So, um, I was not in approval of what is a fairly new public school curriculum. Uh, I believe that we're teaching sex education at too young of age. I want to be clear, it's not that I'm opposed to sex education. Uh, but I think it's starting at too early in age. Okay? We need an age appropriate curriculum. And I've never been in favor of the LGBTQ curriculum in our public schools. I think there are things being taught in our home schools that belong at home at the kitchen table between parent and child when the parent decides it's time because each child progresses at a different so what I can do on day one is replace everyone on the state board of education and you'll get a new public school curriculum on day one that emphasizes critical life skills vocational training with an age appropriate curriculum that respects parental rights. I don't feel based on what you pay in taxes, there's little enough school time today that you should have to worry about opting your kids out of classes. That's lost school time. Now, I was raised at a time when my parents didn't have to worry about me walking to school and they didn't have to worry about what I was learning in school. And we need to get back to that day. So, my attorney general on day one, specific to this, will also get rid of policy 5756. For those of you that are not familiar with follow policy 5756, this was not codified by the legislature, this is an executive order put in place by the governor and attorney general. I do not believe that school districts should be keeping secrets from parents. In my mind, this is immoral, it's indecent, it's wrong, and it's dangerous. Our children are best served on school districts and parents work in partnership, not in secret.   Mental health and addiction are nonpartisan crisis. How do you ensure that treatment is accessible, affordable, and equitable, especially for vulnerable populations. First, let me say that health care is a right, not a privilege. And what concerns me greatly, uh, particularly in our urban centers, um, in minority communities, you do not see the health care systems expanding with primary care clinics in these areas. Um, more times than not, they may be expanding in areas where everyone is covered, has health insurance, and there's an economic reason for that. But I believe that everyone in this state should have convenient access to high quality care. and I'll work in partnership with our health care systems to ensure that there is. With regard to the mental health crisis, when I was a Sy County Commissioner, we did something no other county did in the state. We created the first community mental health center cuz what we were hearing from the community was that if they had a family member in crisis, you couldn't get an appointment for 2 or 3 months down the road, that's going to be too late. And what was happening is people had ending up in the emergency room and that could be too late. So, we opened up a 24/7 community mental health center. The psychiatrist, the psychologist, the licensed clinical social workers were county employees and everyone had access no matter what their insurance coverage. Where am I getting at? As governor, I'm going to work in partnership with our 21 counties to ensure that in each and every community there are mental health clinics that people can get quick, convenient access to high quality care from professionally trained mental health professionals. I also think we need to take the same approach with regard to homelessness. We should not address the homelessness issue in New Jersey 564 towns at a time. As someone who served as a county commissioner, I will tell you that county government in this state is an underappreciated and underleveraged governmental entity. It's a regional service provider. And so, as governor, I'll be working in partnership with our county governments to ensure that there's access to mental health services because we do have mental health crisis in the community. But we'll do the same thing when it comes to homelessness. Our next question is, what is your position on the impact of the Big Beautiful Bill on New Jersey Medicaid recipients? So, let's talk about a few things the Big Beautiful bill does. Number one, it allows us now to deduct up to $40,000 of our property taxes on our federal tax return. It was 10,000, now it's 40,000. It also doubles the child care tax credit for those families with young children. It doesn't tax tips, social security, or overtime. Okay? And the only it does is provides a magnificent tax credit for those who may send your children to private school. On the Medicaid front, you now, if you're on Medicaid, will have to verify your eligibility twice a year, not once a year. Do you know who it was that originally put that policy, please? President Barack Obama. President Trump kept it his first term. President Biden put it back to once a year. I don't think it's unfair, and some may disagree, and I respect that. I don't think it's unfair for you to have to verify your eligibility for Medicaid twice a year. The other thing this bill does, it says if you're on Medicaid and you're ablebodied and your children are 15 or older, in order to continue to qualify for Medicaid, you have to provide 20 hours a week of either work, volunteerism, or education. We may disagree, but I believe that's fair. And what some are doing who may be running for governor is trying to scare people that they're going to lose their Medicaid. You're not going to lose Medicaid. But I do believe that those two reforms are fair. I do believe those two reforms are fair. Not because every person that's on Medicaid is gained from the system, but there is fraud in the system and all of us should be concerned about any type of fraud. Although I realize that you have a vast platform, if you have to make a choice, which item from your platform are you the most passionate about? Property Texas. And let me tell you why. Because it doesn't matter if you're a homeowner, a tenant, or a business owner. Property taxes affects you. When the landlord gets increases in the property tax, it has to be passed through the tenant. So tenants are now exempt from this property tax crisis all across New Jersey. And so we need to find a way to lower our property taxes. I do believe we need a more equitable distribution of state aid to our school districts. Uh because the school budget is usually the largest portion of the property tax bill. There's a missile tax, there's a county tax, there's a school tax. Um, and you've heard what it is I want to do for seniors for reason once you're at age 70 and for firsttime home buyers. Okay? But we need to encourage our towns and most specifically our school districts to share resources to try to get the most out of every single buck to address this crisis. The property tax crisis touches everybody. And so we're going to be very, very aggressive and doing everything we can to lower the property taxes. Uh the next question that I have and I think pastor really addressed that when he was speaking up here is on Charlie Kirk. The question is what are your thoughts on Charlie Kirk's kill? It was Charlie Kirk that said that when the public discourse ends the violence begins. How ironic. Uh this is heartbreaking news. The pastor mentioned the fact that this is a father of two small children and now we have a wife without a husband and two parents without a son. What troubles me most, and we were talking about this before, what troubles me most about this um hysterical is there was a time when someone had enacted this kind of violence, it was someone maybe middle-aged, who was destitute, who had lost their job, who had lost their family, who had had terrible things happen in their own personal life, and their heart was filled with faith, hate, and they lost their faith. This was a 22y old man who had his whole life ahead of him. Not too dissimilar from the young man who executed the healthc care CEO on the streets of Manhattan. It's this is a great concern with regard to what's happening to that generation. And um let me say this. I will try as best I can to solve all of our greatest problems. I will try. I can't promise you. What I can promise you is I will try. But know this, there are things that only the family can solve that your government, despite its best attempts, is never going to be able to solve as well as the family. And I think that we have to leverage our people of faith all throughout New Jersey to get back to the basics in taking care of family, ensuring that family members don't suffer from isolation whose hearts are not filled with hate. And so it's heartbreaking news and I think we're all grappling. You know, one thing I always say as governor, my first job is to listen. I'm all ears because I really dove best ideas are out there in the community as to how to address our greatest problems. But I'm very very worried about that generation. Why would a 22-year-old be filled with such hate to do such a thing? So this gets back to education a bit. What I really would like to see in our public schools and I will work to make happen is that even at the youngest ages, a course that speaks to New Jersey's diversity as the most diverse state in the country and the need to develop tolerance as a personal attribute. We are not teaching that to our children. And I think that's something we need to do in our schools. I'm a big believer in the golden rule. Do unto others as you would have others do unto you. I'm a big believer in teaching children and teach children of any age will understand this lesson. You're to show respect for everyone no matter how different they may be from you. Now, you would hope that lessons being taught at home. But if we're going to get away from the three Rs for a second, I think it ought to be on things like that. That's a lesson a kindergarten could understand. And we're not to tolerate hate and bigotry and racism and prejudice. There's only one thing I know can about physics. We're all related. Similar topic. What is your position on DEI? Are you in support of DEI initiatives and provide examples if so? What I'm in support of is ensuring as governor that there's equal opportunity, equal opportunity for a great education, equal opportunity to advance yourself economically and achieve that thing that I believe everybody wants in the end, which is security. I do believe in a meritocracy, but I also know there's people in our community who've been marginalized and disadvantaged, and I gave you an example of the commercial lending act not being adhered to. So I really believe that my job is to ensure that everyone has equal opportunity. And what I will put in place in my administration on day one is a chief business opportunity officer to ensure that and I gave an example before that for example minority owned businesses are getting their fair share of state contracts, their fair share of municipal contracts, their fair share of county contracts. This is something I will model after Mayor Adams, who has been very, very successful in his first four years in ensuring that minority owned business get their fair share of state contracts. Okay, next question. This is good questions. Why is it that in some New Jersey townships, parents have to pay a fee in order for their children to attend school? uh in order for their children to attend school for the whole day. Anytime beyond 12 p.m. the parents are required to pay fee per week. Uh I was not aware of that unless what we're talking about is an afterchool program. Okay. After school care. Uh we now have a program in New Jersey that's providing free prek which decreases obviously child care costs for families that have four-year-olds. Um, but if there's a school district has decided that, I'm going to leave that up to a community. But let me say something else about education. The party to which I do not belong will always portray themselves as the one that takes better care of the marginalized and the disadvantaged and minority communities. And in we have a failing school system. 80% of children are not on grade level for reading, writing math. And Dave Kelly is here today as a member of my team who courageously ran for school board last year, came real close. I'm hoping he'll come back. Who is it that has school choice? People with money. People with the financial wherewithal to afford private school tuition. In the last seven almost eight years now, the Murphy administration has not approved one charter school or vouchers for the North school system. So they're so supportive of the marginalized and disadvantaged minority communities with school system failing. Why is they won't give you school choice? I have my differences with Chris Christie, but he approved eight chart schools in New York and I visited one the other day. And I got to tell you, not only are the test scores phenomenal, but what I saw, what I witnessed was phenomenal. I will provide families whose school system is failing them a choice. Voucher program, charter schools. What's going on today? We are disadvantaging an entire generation of children if the school system is failing. And I believe parents need a choice. Okay? and not just fighting for your traction. Parents and supporters from New Jersey parental rights have been praying for you. The question is, are you committed to to defend our first amendment rights as Christians relig religious liberty in New Jersey public schools? Can we be more specific by what type of religious Christian religious liberty? Are we saying that we want to have the ten commandments in our public schools or that we want to open the day with prayer? That is not in the question. Separation of church and state is one of the principles upon which this country was founded. One of the principles. I have senior citizens that'll say to me all the time, \"Why do I need to continue to pay the school portion, my property tax bill since I haven't had kids in the school system for 20 years, 30 years?\" And what I tell them each time is because it is an American ideal for all of us to invest in the future. And that investment comes in the form of public education. So I'm not a proponent of telling senior citizens, pay the tax, pay the county tax, but you won't have to worry about paying the public education tax. What I will do is try to make the pain less acute by freezing the property taxes, making all retirement taxfree, and as a senior citizen allowing you to deduct 100% of your property taxes on your New Jersey tax return. This question is pretty simple. Women's rights, pro-choice. What's your position? Uh, I have a very very strong libertarian streak and I want to apologize in advance to anyone who's offended by my position, but libertarians don't like government involved in deep and personal decisions. I'm kind of a live and let live guy and so I've always respected a woman's right to choose with some restrictions. So for example um the proposal in my platform says that at the 20 week mark you can't choose abortion as an elective surgery. I do believe there's a point in time in pregnancy where it's in my opinion wrong to have an abortion. Um but let me tell you what we're not going to do under Governor General. Number one, we're not going to celebrate abortion. Uh, number two, we're not going to make New Jersey the abortion capital of the country. We have politicians in this state that will say to you, if you cannot get your abortion state X, come to New Jersey. You can have performed here. I don't believe we should do that. Um, and let me say something else I feel very strongly about. I will appoint judges that agree with me. I feel very, very strongly about parental notification. Now, in this state, your child cannot get their ears pierced without parents permission if they're under the age of 18. I'm a father of one daughter. If she was 15 or 16 or 17, she was going to get an abortion. I'd want to be notified. The opposition party doesn't believe that. I think that's wrong. And so I think that's a very very extreme if not radical position to celebrate abortion to invite people to the state to have an abortion performed or for us to not have permanent notification. But as a libertarian I do support a woman's right to choose. I think that decision between her, her partner, her faith and her healthcare professionals in the earliest stages of pregnancy. Don't judge this book by its public.  That's what I saw face. Don't judge the book right. What plan do you have for migrants in New Jersey? And followup is what do you know about Trump's mass deportation plan in ice? I believe the primary reason why President Biden lost the race, President Trump is Trump said he would secure the border. I think an overwhelming number of Americans when they saw what was going on each day along the border were very very concerned and I do think that was the dividing issue. I think it's what carried Trump to win all seven swing states and he actually improved in New Jersey by 10 points. His loss in 2020 was 16 points. This time around was six points. And I will tell you that people across the state overwhelming do not want sanctuary cities and that's not be a sanctuary state. And I feel that way. He secured the border. He's trying to make the country safe. I'm trying to make New Jersey safe. So I'm always very transparent about my positions. Will not have sanctuary cities, nor will we be a sanctuary state. That restricts our police in certain ways and I believe encourages illegal immigration. Um, do I believe that someone should be able to just cross the border, give birth, and have that baby be an American citizen? I don't. That's not what the intent was of the 14th Amendment. The 14th Amendment was specific to the slaves who had just been freed that confirmed that they were American citizens. All were American citizens. And so I support the president in him detaining and deporting anybody who came here illegally who comes from a history of criminality in their country of origin. Let's go back. I support the president in detaining and deporting anybody who came here illegally and committed a crime once they arrived. Unless we're deporting them to a country that is not an ally, doesn't observe the rule of law, and doesn't incarcerate you upon return. If someone here illegally had violated you, justice needs to be served. And if we deport them to a country where they're set free, justice wasn't served. So, we'll do the incarceration. The president was recently asked, \"What about everyone else? What about people who've been here 5, 10, 15, 20 years? What about the children of undocumented immigrants that were brought in under no power of their own? His answer was that's difficult. It is. And I do not believe the president is going to deport the 14, 15, or 16 million people who are here in an undocumented way. I don't. And so I believe that people have been here for 5 10 15 20 years have not been at all dependent on our social safety net which means your tax dollars or hasn't committed a crime. I think that we should find a pathway to recognition. Well, the next question is actually it always it always worries me when somebody starts that question. Well, actually this here and now is going to be the most difficult question I can tell you already. How do your proposed policies align with Trump's agenda? 47:07 I'm always going to do right by the 9.3 million people I represent. And if the president is doing something that I think goes against the grain of what it is we here need to do here in New Jersey, I'm going to pick up the phone. And let me say this, if it's Governor Chedelli versus Governor Cheryl, he's picking up the phone. It's Governor Chedelli. Relationships are important. Relationships are important. Let me say something else about relationships. I'm the nominee for the Republican party. This is a competition. If Jake Paul Wolf and I go play golf tomorrow, it's $5 gold. I win. I want my money and tell you when you say I want to do my money. I'm taking him out of dinner and it's on me. I've got relationships with people in the legislature. You ask Democrats about Jack Chedro in the state legislature and they'll tell you not hyperartisan, not rigid in his ideology. He's a policy guy. Cuz I want idealistic to think that I still believe the best policy makes the best politic. But I'm always going to do right by New Jersey. Now, do I thank the president for putting a temporary halt on the wind farms off the Jersey Shore? I think that's bad energy policy. And I will tell you, nobody Jersey Shore wants those wind farms. Young, old, male, female, liberal, conservative, for different reasons, but nobody wants those wind farms. And they're not the energy to our not the answer to our energy crisis. I appreciate the fact that he's beating up on the New York Democrats over the congestion crisis plan. Shame on them for fixing their subway system on the backs of New Jerseyians. They go ahead in that plan. Let me tell you what I'm going to do. Any New York plate that comes through the tunnels or over the bridge in the morning to New Jersey, I'm going to hit them on congestion pricing plans to make transit. We are not pushing. I thank the president for his budget bill, what it did for child care, what it did for those that depend on social security tips and overtime. what it does for those that send their kids to private school, what it does on our federal tax, our property taxes. Where do I disagree with the president? I don't like the fact that his department of defense is talking about downsizing the Pikatini arsenal in Mars County. That's a thousand jobs. That's a thousand jobs. I'm not so comfortable with the president having approved for the Empire wind farm off of Long Island. I'm hoping that doesn't end up making its way down the Jersey Shore because I'm telling you, we don't want those wind farms. But I will stand up and know this. I was the only Republican across the country to call for the resignation of Iowa Congressman Steve King for his offensive rhetoric toward minorities. I was the only Republican of the state of New Jersey to call on Chris Christie to resign after he canled his presidential campaign. And the moment he came home, he went back out on the campaign show. We didn't have a governor for like two years because he was touring the country campaign for president. So I've not been afraid to stand up to my point.  The next question is voter registration. Uh President Donald Trump just announced blocking nonprofits from voter registration. And this looked like a symbol to me. It says federal massization surveys. Uh I was not aware that he did that, but I would disagree with that. I think any and all organization should strive to register as many people as possible, particularly nonprofits, particularly faith-based organizations. We want more people to participate in the election process. So I have to study that. That's what his reasoning was. We want more people participating in the election process. This is the last question I have for this afternoon. Are there that's almost as bad as well. Are there going to be any adjustments for the minimum wage? And the second part of the question is what's going to happen with Medicare? They said 30 thou 300,000 people are going to be removed. So they said that 300,000 people on Medicaid are going to be removed and we talked about that yesterday. And the reason why they're saying that is because of new verification processes. you now have to verify your eligibility twice a year, not once a year. And um if you're again ablebodied and your children are 15 or older, you need to provide 20 hours a week of work, education, or volunteerism in order to continue continue. And so what I believe my opposition party is doing is what we call fear-mongering, scaring you that you're going to lose your Medicaid coverage because of those two things. I think those two things are reasonable. And as I said before, one of the two President Barack Obama put in place induced terms in office. First part question had to deal with the minimum wage. Minimum wage. So listen, people need a living wage here in the state. And by constitution, it readjusts every January. So this is no longer something that the legislature votes on or the governor signs into action. When it was put on the ballot back when, when it went to $15 an hour, it now adjusts automatically according to the rate of inflation, it reached to help keep pace with inflation and provide a livable wage. Right. uh what is your position on re-entry individuals coming home from prison uh and and providing re-entry service and how do you feel about addiction being viewed as treatment and treatment as a as a medical disease? So earlier today, I promised the passion that one thing I never do is come into particularly the minority community and talk about a re-entry program cuz that's what most politicians do and I find that offensive. But since you asked the question, Bren, I feel very very strongly that whenever someone is serving time, the last 6 to 12 months of time has to be dedicated to learning a trade in a vocational educational setting so that the moment they are free, they have a job. So, not only are we providing someone with a skill, we also have a placement service that has them start on day one after having served their time in a job that hopefully that something they really want to do or they wouldn't have chosen that uh that training uh while they're serving their time. And we've seen re-entry programs that are very very successful across the state. We've seen this with Governor Jim McGrevy whose program that I visited frequently a couple of times very very successful. I believe in those type of programs. I think they're critically important. uh anyone who has an addiction in my mind should not be incarcerated. They need to be treated and so we need to make sure there's proper treatment uh opportunities for people to cure themselves of their addiction. Thank you. That's it. Let's give both of our questions a hand. This is I want to get her back up before we leave. She's going to bless us for uh I I want to really thank all of you uh for participating in this session and the way you conducted yourselves. You really deserve an applause. I'm not surprised. You're a leader. I wonder that you all would have done this in such a way to make Jack feel so at home. They really be himself. And so, as I said earlier, we do not endorse candidates. You do great. You do great. And I think Jack deserves a grade for what he said to us today. So, I want those of you that are registered voters, if you know someone that is not, please get them to register and let's vote because that makes us do better as Pastor Miles puts to us today. And I'm just honored that you all are what you're trying to do to change the way we live, the way we communicate. You know, I live in Milstone and so, you know, my children, they brought up uh when they gave out the computers, you know, in North and other places, it was one to every 20 students. My children were all given iPads uh which they really didn't need. Parents could have afforded uh to pay for them themselves. And so we really need to just change the leveling field, you know, but we all included uh so that we can make New Jersey what it should be today. I want to ask Jack to give us some final remarks, statement, uh, and then I want you to come up and bless us one more time and then we're going to get out of here. You did not have to stay this long. Uh, you did not have to stay this long. Uh, and we're just so grateful uh, that you came. Uh, Pastor Burgers, so glad to see you and other pastors and leaders, whether you're down or up. Uh I know that Zachariah will be post posting that on his uh Facebook Bass News YouTube right news. Uh but thank you Jacob. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your team. Thank you for sharing with me. Let's give her a hand  statement. Rachel, anything you want to say? Thank you. Uh, just really just thank you all for the security police department. Thank you so much and our security team. I wanted to make sure that we were safe. I wanted to make sure that we were safe and I hope that I conducted myself in a way uh that was respectful to let you know uh that I have made a choice in my life and that is to do better. Amen. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, Jack. Great to be with you all today. Thank you so much for the warm welcome. Thank you for listening. Thank you for the questions which were very thoughtful and spot on. Uh whether or not you decide to vote for me, know this. The day after election, we lay down arms. I think one of the great challenges we face today is that um you know, my parents said, they voted for what they voted for, but the day after the election, whoever it was that won, they wanted to be successful. I think it's unamerican not to want our leadership to be successful once the competition is over. That's right. Right. So, let's come together. Let's make it happen in New Jersey. The theme for this campaign is it's time. It's time. Now, I did I said that yesterday. I was at an event. Guy started yelling at me saying, \"It's past time. It's basketball.\" I get it. I get it. But I do think it's time. We need to change here in New Jersey. And I'll provide you the change that we can all benefit from. So, I look forward after we win to working in partnership with you to make our communities better, make our state better, make our country better, and uh get us back to where we need to be. But faithbased organizations are going to lead the way. Faith-based organizations  to make that happen. Thank you very very much. She got a beautiful  outstanding job.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 21 Gubernatorial Debate transcript 2:12 Thank you. Good evening, New Jersey. My name is Mikey Cheryl and I have a different kind of background, so I'm going to be a different kind of governor. I'm a former Navy helicopter pilot, federal prosecutor, member of Congress, and Jason and I are raising our four great kids. And so that's why I am laser focused on driving down costs for families like yours. I'm going to declare a state of emergency on day one, freezing your rate hikes. I'm going to demand transparency and accountability from our government to save you time and money. And for those of you that's been who have been following Jack's race, you've heard a lot of nonsense and you're going to hear a lot more tonight. But there's a clear choice. In 1990, Jack took his first of many votes to raise your taxes. That was the same year I took my first of many oaths to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. He'll support abortion bans. I'll support your personal freedoms. He'll do whatever Trump tells him to do and I will fight anybody to work for you. Thank you, Jack.  Jack Titterelli, it is your turn to deliver your opening statement. Jack Chedarelli. New Jersey, we need change. We need a hands-on CEO governor who's from New Jersey that knows exactly what needs to be done and is willing to do it. Overwhelmingly, New Jerseyians feel that we're heading the wrong direction. Here's why. There's an affordability in this crisis because of the taxes you pay and now because your electricity rates. There's a public education crisis in this state. We've slipped from 2 to 12 on the national report card because we no longer focus on critical life skills and vocational training. There's a public safety crisis in this state. Non-violent crime is through the roof. Breakins, car thefts, flash mobs in our malls and Jersey Shore. There's an overdevelopment crisis in this state where we're taking garden right out of the Garden State with all the overdevelopment. We're the worst place in the country in which to do business. These are the issues. My opponent will blame all these things on the president. Make no mistake, the party that's controlled our legislature for 25 years, the party that's controlled the executive branch for the eight years are the reason why we are today. I look forward to discussing my specific plans on how to fix New Jersey. Thank you both. Thank you both. All right, we're going to head over to our panel. Our first question comes from David Wildstein and it goes to Mikey Cheryl. Congressman, one of the things I've heard New Jerseyians say is that your campaign has been uh has had plenty of broad talking points, uh, but has been light on specific fixes to the state's problems. So, what do you say to people who question your mastery of state government issues and your desire to speak more about New Jersey uh, and how they'll deal with the White House and Congress than about local issues? So, I'm the only one that has a plan to actually take on the tough problems of New Jersey. In fact, Jack's been in office before, and a lot of the things he complains about, he was the architect of. But that's why I've committed to declaring a state of emergency on energy cost on day one to drive down your cost, to freeze rate hikes. I'm going to have a dashboard so you can see where your permitting is as we cut through red tape and regulatory issues so we can drive down cost. I'll make sure that we have a report card online so you can see exactly where your money goes and hold me accountable when the state's not performing well. So that's the kind of transparency, accountability, and cost savings I'm going to bring to government. Jack doesn't have a plan to do it because all he does is say that Trump's right. It's okay to drive up your tariffs. It's okay to have the one big beautiful bill which drives up your health care and utility costs. Not on my watch.  You just cited a campaign that's short on specifics and what you just got is 60 seconds of generalities and platitudes. My plan is very specific on how to fix New Jersey when it comes to affordability. How about we make all retirement income taxfree? How about we freeze property taxes once you hit 870? How about we allow you to deduct 100% of your property taxes on your New Jersey tax return? How about we make the first two years of income post high school, post college taxfree? so young people can get a start. How about we stop with all the overdevelopment by revisiting our Mount Laurel housing doctrine? How about we take the handcuffs off our police? These are the specifics that we could talk about on how to fix New Jersey.  Our next question. Our next question is just a production note. We lost our monitors out here. I'm not sure if the control room knows that or not, but our next question is go Micah Rasmusen and it goes to Jack Titerelli. When you first ran for governor, you were often critical of President Trump. Today, he says you've changed. What advice can you give sincere New Jerseyians who are closer to where you were in 2017 and say they can't look beyond the nation's border chief accepting a bribe or the F FCC silencing descent or those January 6 pardons for attacking our police? Well, let's think about talk about what the president has done for New Jersey since he took office. He's put a temporary halt on wind farms off the Jersey shore. I'll make that permanent. He's beating up He's beating up on the New York Democrats over their congestion pricing plan, which I think is an egregious money grab. We shouldn't be paying for their subway system. He's also quadrupled the salt deduction on our federal tax returns. The big beautiful bill also doubled the child care tax credit for those with young children. It also doesn't tax tips, overtime, and social security. It provides a magnificent tax credit for those that send their kids to private school. I want you to think about those four things. They're good for all New Jerseyians. She voted no. My opponent did on that bill. But make no mistake. Make no mistake. My job is to represent and advocate. That's our timer. I've got your timer. Okay. My job is to advocate for the 9.3 million citizens of this state. And I'll always do right by the citizens of this state, no matter who occupies the White House. Mr. I'm sure he would like you to focus on those four things because he doesn't want you to focus on this tariff plan which is putting small businesses out of business and freezing hiring from our large businesses. He doesn't want you to focus on the employment numbers or the fact that the deficit has gone up by 70 billion dollars in the year Trump's been in office. He doesn't want you to focus on the one big beautiful bill which is going to raise families utility costs by hundreds of dollars which is going to imperil the health care of one in three children which already now they're going after affordable care act. So they're taking away healthcare from people who have it healthcare insurance and then they're trying to drive up costs for people who already have the healthare insurance. So in every single way we're seeing costs go up on New Jersey families. And Jack just says he has nothing he disagrees with Donald Trump on. That's not leadership. This state needs real leadership and that's exactly what I'll do as governor. Our next question, Micah, are there chances for rebuttals? That wasn't it wasn't an attack. We're going to go on to our next question. Um, and I also want to ask the audience if we could refrain from applauding because every few seconds takes up time. Sophie has the next question going to Mikey Cheryl. Congresswoman, in recent years and months, politics has grown more divisive, leading to a rise in politically motivated threats and violence. Would you support legislation to make political violence a hate crime? And as governor, what would you do to keep political tensions from escalating? So, this is something I think about all the time, and everyone in elected office now faces this threat to themselves, but worse, to their families. And so we're all very concerned about it, which is why we advocated to the state to make sure not only myself, but Jack had more money to support his personal security and my family security as well. It's why we continue to work to uh fight against political hatred. And so we need to do more because in this nation, we should be able to have free speech. I've vowed to defend and fight for free speech my entire life, but it should never devolve into political violence. That is something I've also stood against my entire life. And I worry very much because now too many people are thinking to themselves, I'm not sure if I should go into political office. I'm not sure if I should run because I don't want to imperil my family. And that's why I continue to fight hard to protect people running to make sure we have free speech in this nation. And we always stand against political violence. Jack Tedelli, I think it's the responsibility of any public official and uh candidate for office to engage in rhetoric that doesn't divide us. My campaign has been about uniting us, not dividing us. I do think we need to take down the temperature a whole lot. So, I support the question was whether or not I support because a bill was recently introduced in the legislature by one of our Republican state senators whether or not to make political violence a hate crime and put some real legal teeth behind it. I don't think she answered the question. The answer to the question is yes. I believe that we should do that here in New Jersey. And again, I think we all have a responsibility to engage in rhetoric that doesn't divide us and doesn't promote hate. And this campaign from the very beginning has had a very positive energy about it. It's a campaign that's about uniting, not dividing. It's a campaign that's about bringing people together, not dividing us. It's a campaign that's about people, not power or politics. And so my opponent on Friday went down to Washington, voted yes on a resolution to celebrate Charlie Kirk's life, but then within minutes sent out a statement that basically condemned him. I think that was wrong. You can have 30 seconds to respond. That's a neat trick to say you don't want to divide people. and then in your answer bring up something that's very divisive. Here's the thing. I care deeply. I care deeply about this country. I stand against political violence. The videos that came out about after Charlie Kirk shooting were horrific. And I feel horrible because my kids have seen them. And so I can't even imagine how the Kirk family feels. And that should never happen to anyone because they speak out. And I also have stood up my entire life and I've taken numerous oaths up to and including offering to die for this country for free speech. And so I think it's fair to have free speech, but I think it should go to everyone to Jimmy Kimmel and to myself as well. Final word, Jackelli. 15 seconds. I ask the audience to please remain quiet. 15 seconds for you. She still hasn't answered your question. And we see this time and time in the campaign. Generalities, platitudes, ducking the direct question by not giving a direct answer. That's just not true. My direct answer is I voted to protect free speech. I voted to end political violence. I also think it's fair, Jack, to speak up when you disagree with something. And so if you want to stand up that Martin Luther King was a bad guy or that women should submit to their husbands, you Jack are welcome to do that. And I have the right to say that I disagree with it. Okay, we're going to we're going to move on now. We're going to move on to our audience. Our next question, we have a lot of questions to get to, is from Elisitia. She is a student at Ryder University from Brick. And that will go to Jack Chidarelli. So New Jersey has one of the highest property taxes and costs of living in the nation. What steps would you take to make the state more affordable for workingclass and middle class families? Now, thank you for that question very very much. So we know there's affordability in the crisis. We know that our state budget, it took 238 years to get to 36 billion and in eight years it's gone from 36 to 59 billion. And yet none of that investment has been made to make life more affordable. In fact, it's only become more unaffordable here in the state of New Jersey. So, there's a number of very specific proposals in my platform. We talked about a few already. Making all retirement income tax-free for our seniors because they worry about living out their lives in a home. Freezing property taxes once you hit 870 for life. Allowing seniors to deduct 100% of their property taxes on New Jersey tax return. Capping property taxes at 1% of the assessed value home if you're a first-time home buyer. making the first two years out of high school, the first two years out of college tax-free so you help get started here. These are just some of the things that we can do to make Jersey more affordable for everybody. And so, but what you'll also see is somebody that's going to be very responsive about the way we spend our money. I will be very responsibly and surgically reduce the size and cost of our state government to afford a tax cut for individuals and businesses.  Thank you. Um, I've been laser focused on driving down costs for New Jerseyians. Jack, on the other hand, has voted at every single level of government to raise your taxes. In fact, he's voted against over a billion dollar in property tax relief and he's supported Trump and implementing over $30 billion against property tax relief. So, in every way, he's raised costs on New Jerseyians. That's why I'm going to get into office and make sure I'm lowering them by sharing services in school administrative costs and municipal courts and continuing to hammer home the way in which we can support seniors with anchor and stay New Jersey so that they aren't here susceptible to the constant increases in property taxes. I'll continue to lower your cost and Jack's going to raise them at every level. 30 seconds Jack. So, a couple things about the um the anchor and state New Jersey program. I don't think somebody making $500,000 a year should get a property tax rebate in this state. Now, I I just that to me is not right. I think we should use the money to spread out. But let me say something else. I think it's insulting here in New Jersey when we take money out of your right-hand pocket, put some back in your lefthand pocket, and call it a fancy name. But one other thing about the affordability crisis, remember one thing that she'll never remind you of. The Democrats have controlled our state legislature for 25 years. The Democrats have controlled the executive branch, the governorship for eight years, and look where we are today. All right, we're going to go back to the audience. Our next question is coming from Frederick. Frederick is a professor here at Ryder University and he is from Hamilton. Frederick's question is going to go to Mikey Cheryl. How would you reduce the New Jersey tax burden on senior citizens? Thank you. This is something uh that as you just heard, Jack is against, but I am for reducing the property tax burden on our seniors because it's too expensive to stay here, watch your grandchildren grow, live on a fixed income when you constantly see your taxes going up. It's why I've been supportive of stay and anchor to make sure that our seniors can afford to stay here in retirement and stay with their families as opposed to moving out of our state. objected. This is starting to sound like a number of her commercials on TV. They're not completely truthful. Um, so a couple of things to be specific. Make all retirement income tax-free the way it is in Pennsylvania. Number one, freeze your property taxes for life once you hit age 70. Allow seniors to deduct 100% of their property taxes on their New Jersey tax return. Those are just some of the things that we can do across the state here in New Jersey. So, um, you're not hearing any specifics and, uh, again, the anchor program, stay New Jersey, they're in part gimmick. Why do we take money out of your right-hand pocket? Put some back in your left-hand pocket and then give it a fancy name. That's what the Democrats have been doing for years. I prefer not to take out of your pocket to begin with. And let me go as far as to say we need to simplify our income tax rates for everybody. Pennsylvania has a 3% flat tax. Ours is 10.75. I'm proposing three new tax brackets. 3%, 4%, and 5%. We need to be regionally competitive. We're losing people to Florida. We're losing people to Pennsylvania. We've got to stop it. You can have 30 seconds. So, talk about vague programs and talk about misleading statements. Here's Jack's proposal to raise cost on everything and food and clothing on the table. This is what he's talking about that he won't tell you. 10% increases on groceries in our state. This is exactly what he has continued to bring up since 2017. And then when he's called on it, he says, \"Oh, I just said we should put it on the table.\" We know it's on the table, Jack. We want it off the table. Final word, Jack, to our next question then. So, if any of you think I'm going to raise your sales tax to 10%, I got a bridge I want to sell you for about 50 cents. She knows it's a lie. They're trying to exploit you. They're trying to manipulate you. She knows she's in trouble in this campaign. So, this campaign is going to lie to you over and over again. Fasten your seat belts for the next 44 days because that's exactly what's going to happen. So, we're going to lower the overall tax burden for all New Jerseyians. You've heard me give you specifics for every class. We can do this if we're responsible with our spending. And I will cut the size and cost of the state government to afford a tax cut for everybody. Under Governor Cedarelli, everybody's tax burden will be lessened, not increased. Our next question, we're going back to the audience. We're going to Michael. Michael is an alum of Ryder University and from Lawrenceville. Michael, your question is going to Jack Chidarelli. Um, the back and forth blame on electricity rates has grown a little tiresome and frankly, I would like to hear a little more specifics because we all know that there are many factors that contribute to our rate increases. So, without blaming each other, what specifically you're going to do to tackle things like the grid operator, state mandates, and other impacts that rise our costs. So, Michael, I don't think it's blame when you're giving facts. And here are the facts. When Phil Murphy took office, we were an electricity exporter. We produced more electricity than we needed. He shut down shut down six different electricity generation plants. He put an unofficial moratorum on natural gas. He didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey, zero carbon emissions. He didn't accelerate solar. talked to solar developers who want to use the rooftops of warehouses which is prime real estate for solar arrays. Didn't accelerate that. What he did do is he bet it all on wind. Now if he was from New Jersey and anybody who was from New Jersey would know that the Jersey Shore is sank sank here in this state. Nobody wants wind farms off our Jersey shore. Male, female, young and old, Republican, liberal, conservative liberal for different reasons. What I've said all along is I'll re reopen and repurpose the plants. We'll expand our nuclear footprint in South Jersey. We will accelerate solar on the rooftops of our warehouses. And we're pulling out the regional greenhouse gas initiative. That carbon tax initiative has been a failure. Air's no cleaner. Electricity is only more expensive. And we're not sending rateayer dollars to other states. By pulling out a Reggie, we can save half a billion dollars a year for rate. Dr. Thanks for the question. You know, anybody from New Jersey should know that this has been a long time in coming and that too many people have added to the problem. So whether it's PJM, the grid operator, or FK or BPU, uh whether it's President Trump rolling back some of the initiatives on solar or adding $250 per family to your energy bill, everybody at the table is at fault and they keep dumping the costs onto the rateayer here in New Jersey. That is why I'm freezing rate hikes on the rateayer. Because let's face it, some of our utility companies have made over a billion dollars in profits. And yet, our rateayers are constantly suffering. So, I'm going to freeze those rate hikes by declaring a state of emergency. I'm going to add massive amounts of power into the grid. Right now, we need to produce power here in our state because the market has been screwed up by PJM and because Virginia has a million data centers which are sucking all the power out of our market. So, we need to produce here lower cost here and stop putting the cost on the rateayers of New Jersey. Okay, Laura, our next question. There's a rebuttal allowed. We get 15 seconds each. That wasn't there wasn't an attack. So, we're going to go on to our next question. And our next question is Martha. Well, Our next question from Martha. She is a a writer, a professor writer from Oldbridge. How do you plan to lower rents in New Jersey? And I'm sorry, that goes to Mikey Cheryl. So, this is the number one thing I hear from people across the state when we're talking about affordability. People are saying that they're having too much trouble paying their mortgages, too much trouble paying their rent prices. And we know there are people colluding now in this state to raise rental prices. And we know Jack's not going to do anything about it because one of his biggest donors is actually being taken to court and sued on this very issue. But as governor, I'm going to fight for you. I'm going to make sure we're driving down rental prices, ending the collusion that goes on to drive them up, and continuing to bring more to the market so that people will have better rental prices here across the state.  So, you asked a very specific question. Let me give you a specific answer. Um, the reason why rents are going up is because property taxes are going up. The reason why rents are going up is because insuranceances are going up across the board. The reason why rents are going up is because in many cases, if the tenant doesn't pay electricity, the landlord does, and that's going up. These are all the reasons. And I know often times we talk about homeowners, but we forget that tenants feel the pain, too. Every time any one of those expenses goes up, it gets passed on to the tenant. I have a very specific plan on how to lower property taxes. We need a new school funding formula. A more equitable distribution of state aid to our schools will help lower the property tax from an insurance standpoint. We're such a bad business to do state bad state in which to do business. Businesses have left. We need more competition. We need more insurance companies to come back here. And under my plan, by pulling out of the regional greenhouse gas initiative, we could save a half a billion dollars in electricity on day one. Whether you pay that or the landlord pays that. The regional greenhouse gas initiative has been a failure. Been a failure. My opponent supports offshore wind. It's never going to be able to meet our energy needs and it's very, very expensive. Okay, we're going back over here. Our next question is coming from Joseph. Joseph is a student at Ryder University. Joseph, we are going to bring the microphone over. And uh he's a student from Ryder from Long Valley. And this question is going to Jack Chitterelli. Um, should people in my generation and younger have an expectation of privacy in their lives? I mean, we're living in an age of social media and location tracking for who knows what, you know, from people who knows where. So, should we have the same expectation of privacy that you and your opponent did when you were growing up? Yes.  We're going to take that time and go to make the show. Hey, listen, man. I'm I'm all ears as to enhance is a constitutional right to privacy. And so I hear you loud and clear. We live in an age between the internet and everything else where people put all kinds of things on the internet that kind of invade our privacy. Um so whatever we can do to make sure people's right to privacy is enhanced and protected. I'm all ears on how best to do that. So Joseph, uh what year are you if I can ask? A senior. Okay. So, um, you went through COVID during school, um, like my kids did. And that's probably when you started to get online more and more because your classes were online and so much of your life was online. And that's when we sort of stopped really moving forward on how we protect kids online, for example. It's why I am going to put forward the Kids Online Safety Act, which was killed by the majority in the House, but I am going to make sure we're passing it here in the state so that kids can have better understanding of how to work online and we can keep them safe. There's a mental health crisis in our state. Uh we need to address it. I'm going to have more mental health counselors so that we can all work together to ensure people have that expectation of privacy because we have more coming. We've never appropriately addressed something called section 230 which holds providers liable and we now are looking at AI down the road and how that's going to bring a whole extra set of issues. So starting with the kids online safety act I'm going to work to make sure kids like you do have an expectation of privacy. Thank you. Okay. Our next is there is there an opportunity for further discussion on this issue? 15 seconds. Well, if if we're very very concerned about the welfare of our children, I do not support policy 5756. I don't think that school districts should be keeping secrets from parents. Okay? That's not protecting kids. And if we're concerned about protecting kids, I don't think that biological boys should be paying in girls sports. She opposes me on both of those issues. Did you turn to respond? Go ahead. Go ahead. So, I'm a mom of four kids. And as I mentioned to Joseph, our kids have gone through COVID. There are mental health issues related to that. We have learning loss because of it. Our kids are struggling. And that's why as parents, it's our job to make sure we're keeping our kids safe at every level. As a mom, I'm going to make sure we do that. Obviously, parents know their kids best and they need to be able to determine if there's something they want to opt out of in health class. Time. Thank you. Okay. Our next question is coming from Nancy. And I've been told I'm given permission to say that Nancy, you are 96 years old. 96 years old. And from And from Skilman, New Jersey, Nancy, your question. And that goes to Mikey Cheron. There might be other ways to describe me.  We all know that public education is such a vital part of what makes New Jersey strong. And so my question to both of to you is should school districts be combined to reduce property taxes? How about municipalities? If so, should mergers be compulsory given the fact they almost never happen voluntarily? Thank you very much. So, this is something that I know we have to do here in New Jersey because right now we have more municipalities than California and we have more school districts than municipalities. And it's raising costs on everybody. We have some school districts who have the whole administrative cost, all of the buildings, and yet they're not even running a K through2 school system. So, we do need to merge some of these school districts. We also need to make some county-based school systems. The ones that we have are some of the best performers in our state. And this is a way in which I think we can ensure we're getting great education to people while driving down property taxes, especially in those areas where we're not running a full K through 12 system. Thank you.  564 towns. We are a home rule state and people love their home rule. Even though it might cost more in taxes, I do not believe their state government should force consolidation. That's up to the locals. But I tell you what, if you do consolidate or you do regionalize, Governor Cheddarelli will help incentivize that to make it easier. So if you all make that decision at the local level, we're going to provide incentives. When I was in the state legislature, Princeton Bureau and Princeton Township decided to become one. I worked with the administration at time to provide 100% of the one-time upfront costs to make that more feasible to fix public education. Ma'am, what we have to do, I think, is get back to the basics. Let's get a highquality education system here in New Jersey. You're never going to hear me say we have the best school system in the country because we don't. We've slipped from 2 to 12 on the National Report Card. We've got to get back to basics in teaching critical life skills and providing vocational training opportunities for our students with a more rigorous academic curriculum for our students. We need to get back there. So Mikey Cheryl, let me let me just ask a followup for clarification. Should there be compulsory uh consolidation? So I'd start by offering uh the carrot to help the areas that want to consolidate. But when there are areas that are not putting enough money into ed to students into educators into the buildings and then they are taking a lot of money in property taxes and from the state level then we'll have to start to look at compulsory movements. Laura, do I get another 15 seconds? Go ahead. So let me say something else. When a school system is failing and there are some reasonable metrics that tell us whether or not a school system is failing, there's got to be choice. That choice comes in the form of vouchers. that choice comes in the form of charter schools. My opponent opposes both. There's got to be choice when a school system is failing. I final thought, that's some more misinformation from my opponent. I've actually uh worked hard on charter schools. In fact, uh my lieutenant governor, Dr. Dale Caldwell, has been involved with charter schools, some uh high performing charter schools because I want to make sure that every child in this state has access to a fantastic education. Here are the facts of the matter. Phil Murphy's been in office for eight years and he's only approved one charter school and it was two weeks before the election in 2021 for political reasons. Okay. The Democratic nominee is owned by the NJA union leadership and they hate charter schools. Okay. And educational choice. Okay. We're moving on. Moving on to our next question. Our next question is coming from Olivia from Blackwood and our question goes to Jack Chitterelli. How will you address global warming's disproportionate effects on New Jersey's urban communities of color? Global warming. Yeah. Well, global warming, I've admitted I do think Mother Earth is sending us some powerful signals. I think human activity has a lot to do with that. But we need a rational transition to the future with regard to our energy. And I think that natural gas is a rational transition to the future, as is nuclear energy down in South Jersey. As is solar. We need an allabove approach. It's not just in our urban areas where the climate change is affecting us. The flooding that you see taking place in our suburban communities has a lot to do with the changes in the climate and it's adversely affecting the quality of life in many suburban communities that never used to flood before. But make no mistake, that flooding has a lot to do not just with the type of rain we get today. It has to do with overdevelopment. This is a big difference between the two parties. My opponent believes that we should have highdensity housing in all 564 towns. I don't believe that we should only have affordable housing, high density housing in a town that has infrastructure, mass transit, and um opportunities for jobs. If a town doesn't have infrastructure, mass transit, opportunity for jobs, why are we putting more idling cars on the road?  So, that is a great question. I sat in my first term um in Congress on science, space, and technology and I was the chairwoman of the environment subcommittee. And that, as you might remember, was the year we had the heat dome over Oregon, which put so many different people in danger as they weren't ready to handle it. We've seen flash flooding here in New Jersey, uh killing several people throughout the state. We've seen tornadoes and hurricanes like we've never seen before. Our climate is changing and we need to act because in too many of our urban areas we are seeing high incidences of asthma for example. So we know that we need to act quickly to protect our environment but to also ensure that we have better health outcomes in this state. And that's why as governor I'm going to make sure that we drive down carbon emissions, drive in massive amounts of power to the grid so we can decrease costs and ensure people are paying lower costs. Thank you, Laura. Can we have 15 each? 15 seconds and then our next question. Let me just say this. The way that the Democrats are doing highdensity housing in this state flies in the face of sustainability. They like to portray themselves as the pro- environment party, but there's nothing pro- environment about building highdensity housing in every one of our 564 towns. Final thoughts. Final thoughts. So, I'm really proud of my record here. I was actually a lead person passing the Great American Outdoors Act, which preserves open space across this country and right here in New Jersey. I also have h worked on projects and gotten money for the Bootin Reservoir, the Essex Hudson Greenway, ensuring that we're preserving open spaces while at the same time delivering on housing for people and ensuring that we are lowering carbon emissions in neighborhoods in urban areas. Okay, we have one more question from our studio audience before we're going to go to a commercial break. And that question is coming from John. John is a high school student from Edison, New Jersey. And John's question is going to be going to Mikey Cheryl. Congresswoman, as was said, I'm a high school student who commutes to New York City every single day for that high school. My question to you is, what is your plan to fix New Jersey Transit systemic issues of overcrowding, delays, and outdated infrastructure? Thank you so much. This is something I hear about a lot uh from my husband Jason who's in the audience tonight. He commutes into New York City all the time and he's quit coaching our kids soccer teams. Um he doesn't make it home for dinner. He often gives me frantic calls about whether or not I can drive our kids that night because he's not going to make it home in time. And so that's why I've been laser focused. In fact, in my first term, as Trump held infrastructure week every week and yet failed to fund the gateway tunnel project, I was called the tunnel obsessed congresswoman. And I'm proud to say we delivered on that on the most expensive infrastructure project in the nation, which is key to commuters here. And then when we were seeing summer of hell after summer of hell because the catinary wires were in the way, I demanded Amtrak keep up their rail system better because we utilize it in NJ Transit and got $300 million into Northeast Rail for catary wires. Now I'm on the port authority because they're not handling the wires underneath the tunnel well and we're seeing fire after fire after fire. So, I am going to continue to focus on our rail systems, on systems of transit across this state and make sure that we see updates and see better movement across our state. Thank you, sir. When I'm successful in transforming New Jersey, the hope would be that no one has to go out of state to get anything other than see a Broadway play. What I want to do here in New Jersey is something other states have done. We've got mass transit systems. It's not just trains. The Atlantic City Expressway is a mass transit system with tolls. Parkway and Turnpike are mass transit systems with tolls. New Jersey Transit is a transit system with revenue through fairs. Let's put them all under one roof called the Garden State Transportation Authority. Let's get rid of all these different authorities with all these different management structures. Let's put all under one roof. Better management, better accountability, one management structure, and we'll give it a dedicated revenue stream called the New Jersey State Budget. Okay? That's where we'll provide the funding. I think that'll be a much better job of managing our mass transit systems. But let me also say this with regard to mass transit. We need to re-evaluate every single train line and every single bus line to make sure there's adequate ridership to justify that route so we can dedicate all the resources we have to the most traveled routes. Thank you both. We are going to take a quick commercial break. We want you to stay with us as we continue our New Jersey gubanatorial debate between Mikey Cheryl and Jack Chidarelli. Stay with us.

Hi, I'm Michelle Sukurka, president and CEO of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association. We're excited to join tonight's first gubanatorial debate. As the state's largest and most influential business association, it's our mission to ensure that business is at the center of the next governor's agenda. Because when business thrives, so too does our economy. To take us there, we presented our blueprint for competitive New Jersey to both candidates, the policy roadmap to drive innovation and prosperity in New Jersey. Check it out at njbia.org/b blueprint. We look forward to working with our next governor to put business at the center. Thank you. Heat. Heat.        I'm Laura Jones and welcome back to the alumni gymnast. on the campus of Ryder University in Lawrenville. We're going to get right back to our debate between Jack Chidarelli and Mikey. Cheryl going to our panel now. And Sophie, you have a question that goes to Jack Chedarelli first. Since 2018, New Jersey has been embroiled in a lawsuit arguing more needs to be done to improve the state's segregated school districts, a problem rooted in long-standing housing discrimination and the number of small districts. Would you continue fighting this in court? And what do you think New Jersey can do to achieve less segregated schools? We do have the most segregated schools, but I wonder if we would be having this discussion if the performance of schools with predominantly black student populations were outperforming schools with predominantly white populations. We need to get back on day one to improving all of our schools, and I intend to do that with a high impact curriculum. New Jersey recently slipped from 2 to 12 on the national report cards. Most of that's because we haven't made up for all the learning loss following the pandemic when Philvy and the Democrats shut down our schools for two years. We opened up our nursing homes, but we closed down our schools. Louisiana and Mississippi have moved significantly Louisiana from 48 to 32 with a high impact curriculum. What is that exactly? If your child is behind grade level in any of the critical life skills like reading, writing, and math, that child will spend the next market period and the one thereafter doing nothing other than reading, writing, math to get them on grade level. The data is clear. I'm a data-driven guy as an NBA CPA. If the child is not on grade level for reading, writing, math by the end of 8th grade, more than likely they will be undermployed their entire life. So, while that lawsuit proceeds, let's fix the schools on day one with a high impact curriculum.  So, I spoke before about county-based school systems because that can help address the segregation that we have going on in this state. It's also the way we have some of our best performing high schools. But we need to do more. We need highintensity tutoring because we know there's learning loss. And that's a special kind of tutoring that I've supported here in the state to make sure students get back on track. We also need to address third grade reading and make sure we're pu pushing in phonics-based reading. We know that's the best way to help children read. And it's a reversal of the way reading has been taught lately. And we know third grade is that critical inflection point because if you're not reading at grade level by third grade, you're not going to be able to move on very well to your math and social studies and history work if you can't read your homework. So in these ways, we can really push in as a state, get better outcomes, and address the segregation that we have going on here. Could you clarify if you're going to uh with the lawsuit? Clarify. Could you clarify if you're going to continue to pursue the lawsuit? I don't think it's the governor that's pursuing the lawsuit. The entity that's pursuing the lawsuit, I'm not going to get in the way. What I'm going to do on day one is fix our educational system. It's not the executive branch that's pursuing that lawsuit. They're they're fighting the lawsuit. The state is fighting the lawsuit. Yeah. We're not going to do that if they let the law let the lawsuit proceed. But I'll tell you what, I was in New York this morning at a house of worship that has the largest black congregation in the state. And you know what they said to me? fix our school system. Fix our school system. So, there's a number of metrics that tell us if a school system is failing. Attendance rate, graduation rate, performance on standardized test, readiness for career if you're not going to high school, going to college. If a school system is failing in two, three, or four out of four of those categories, that district, that that community needs choice. I'm going to give them choice. My opponent is not going to give them choice. Mikey, Cheryl, 30 seconds for that. 30 seconds. I think what you just heard is a very clear difference. I care deeply about our school system and I'm going to make sure it performs better. I'm going to make sure that we're educating children for the future, especially with AI coming. But I'm also going to attack the segregation that we have going on in the state. My opponent doesn't care about that. He just wants to talk about the schools, but has not come forward with any solution for the segregation. I care about both. That's what I'm going to do as governor.  Final word. We could integrate the NORC school system tomorrow and it's not going to improve student performance. We need to change the curriculum. Final thought, Mikey Cheryl, before I think you heard again that he has no intention of addressing the segregation in this state. We're going to move on next to Micah Rasmusen and that question goes to Mikey Cheryl. A child died of measles in the United States last week and we have counties in New Jersey like Ocean where the vaccination rates have now fallen below what's required to maintain her immunity. Should New Jersey parents be worried? Yes, New Jersey parents should be very worried. Uh we just had back to school, so many of the parents know there's a lot going around. Um, imagine if it was polio. Right now, we have, I think, over 10 cases of measles so far this year in New Jersey. We are the most densely populated state in the nation. If we are not going to ensure proper vaccinations for our kids, vaccines that have been going on over 50 years and have all but eradicated, things like measles, mumps, reel, rebella, and polio. Now we have babies dying of pertasus or whooping cough because people aren't getting their vaccines. These are eminently curable diseases and we are allowing children to get sick and yes die because we are not appropriately following medical research vaccine protocol in and is governor of this state. I'm joining the northeast group of governors that is going to ensure that we follow medical guidelines and keep our kids safe. uh the rise in things like measles, mumps, woofing cough and the like are very very concerning and once we fall below the her the threshold for her immunity it's of great concern in the community and so I support the vaccine schedule with regard to measles mumps rebella whooping cough polio on down the line we've got to get above the threshold for her immunity to keep our communities safe the obligation of any governor on day one after they take their oath of office is the public health and safety and we'll do that under Governor Chedarelli. I just wish my opponent showed the same concern when it came to biological males participating in female sports. We should be protecting all students. 30 seconds. 30.  You know, it's really interesting. I've been hearing around the state. I've spoken to thousands and thousands of people. I've been to all 21 counties. I keep hearing around the state, Jack Chinarelli will tell anybody whatever they want to hear. And I think we just saw that tonight because he hasn't actually stood up for vaccines. He hasn't stood against RFK. He hasn't mentioned anything about firing the head of the CDC. He doesn't mention anything about how Trump's appointee gets most of his medical information on TikTok and reals.  This is not somebody who's going to keep our kids healthy. objection. The congresswoman is right about one thing. I do get up and down this state. 564 towns, 21 counties, North, Central, South, and Jersey Shore. I'm actually pleasantly surprised to see her tonight. I thought I might see a surrogate. So, if you want to talk about getting up and down the state, if you want this job, interview for the job, get up and down the state. As I mentioned, I've been all up and down the state speaking to thousands of people. And once again, what he doesn't want to address is the fact that he will never stand up against Trump. He will let our cost continue to rise. He will let our kids get unsafe and unhealthy. He won't stand up. He said he's not taking this administration to court in any way, shape, or form. Well, they are driving a $5 billion hole in our budget, and the way we claw that money back is by taking them to court. We ask our audience to please be quiet. Jackie, you have the last word before our next question. Well, listen. No Republican in this state's had a more independent streak than I have. I've called on national prominent Republicans to resign over their rhetoric. I called on Chris Christie to resign. I've always been independent. I'm going to stand up for the people of New Jersey every day to week. Their party's been in control for 25 years and they've had the executive branch for eight years. But you don't hear her. You don't hear my opponent criticizing the current administration or the 25-y year reign of the Democrats. All right. I'm really regretting not bringing my bell tonight to ring on the audience. We love your enthusiasm. Uh but we want to give our candidates as much time as possible. So, we're going to move on. David Wildstein has the next question and that is going to Jack Chidarelli. Thank you. Both of you have at some point in discussing the state's finances said that all options are on the table. So, I want to ask you about an increase in the sales tax. Are you willing to commit to not raise the sales tax if if you become governor? And obviously, I'm looking for a yes or a no, but I know that sometimes I'm I'm disappointed in getting just a one-word answer. Whose turn is it first, Lauren? Jack. We are not raising the sales tax here in New Jersey. What we need to do is lower the income tax and the property tax here in New Jersey. Those are the most burdens and taxes we pay. Pennsylvania's flat tax is 3% on personal income. Our highest bracket is 10.75. Pennsylvania's property taxes on average are $3,000 less per home than ours. What is it that Pennsylvania is doing that we're not? They give Republicans control from time to time. I think that's what they do in Pennsylvania. Listen, it took us 238 years to get the $ 36 billion budget. In 8 years, we went from 36 billion to 59 billion. Can anybody tell me their life is better off than it was eight years ago? Has anything gotten better? I've been here for 64 years. 64 years. I never remember it being this bad. The affordability crisis. Look at your property tax bill. Look at your monthly electric bill. Public safety, public education, overdevelopment, and the worst place in the country to do business. That's why we are where we are today. 64 years. and for over half that time he's been raising taxes on all of us. Um, you know, I can see why your career as a CPA was so short-lived because your math just doesn't add up, Jack. So that's why as we look at a $5 billion hole that we're facing from the federal government, as we're working hard to make sure that we're paying into pensions, at least one of us, to make sure that people have the hard-earned dollars that they've earned over time as we're working to make sure that we have the best public school system in the nation. I'm not going to commit to anything right now because I'm not just going to tell you what you want to hear. Now, Jack raises sales tax all the time. And yet tonight, he said this because like we know, he'll tell you whatever you want to hear. Well, I'm going to tell you the truth. I'm going to be fiscally responsible with your money. I'm going to drive down your cost at every level. And I'm going to make sure your kids have great opportunities here in the state of New Jersey. So, in some of her uh ads, and again tonight, she's implying that I've been a career politician. Here's what she never tells you. I've term limited myself every single time. And at the municipal and county level, I didn't take the salary or the benefits. She never tells you those things. I call for term limits in my platform. And everywhere I've been, I have fought to save people taxes in this state, and I'll do it as your governor. So, I do like the revisionist history because most people in New Jersey know that the reason Jack didn't run for re-election is because he knew he was going to lose. But nevertheless, it doesn't matter. Hey, we have kids in here. It doesn't matter because I'm going to make sure that he doesn't get to serve again when I win for governor in November of this year. There's another big difference between her public service and my public service. It actually cost me money the time I put in and took away from my company. In the seven years that she's been in Congress, she's tripled her net worth. There's another big difference between the two of us. Okay? She broke the law. She had to pay fines for violating federal law on stock trades and stock reporting. And the New York Times reports that while you're sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, you were trading defense stocks. Jack News. Final word. Mikey, Cheryl,  Jack knows, and all of you can confirm that I don't trade individual stocks. He knows this because it's all public. And in fact, there have been articles written about how transparent and ethical I've been going above and beyond the requirements in Congress. And I continue to do that. In fact, I've run the most transparent governor's race that we've seen in the state. Now, I know we could probably continue with any of these topics all night long, but we're going to get back to our uh audience. Our next question comes from Tom from Princeton, and this question is going to Mikey Cheryl first. New Jerseys combined pension and employee health care funding shortfalls exceed hundred billion dollars, and the annual expense for these items consumes over 20% of New Jerseys annual budget. yet the pension plans remain severely underfunded. How would you address these deficits? How would you improve pension security? And would you pursue any structural reforms? Thanks. So, for decades, people have used fuzzy math. It's been a bipartisan thing for governors to not fully fund the pension. So, now we're working to fully fund it, but we're paying seven billion dollars to do so. New York, which runs a far bigger pension system because they've managed that well, is only paying about 1.5 billion. So, if we don't focus on funding this pension, we are mortgaging the future for our children. These are hard-earned benefits that people have paid into, but the state hasn't funded it appropriately. So, we've got to stop taking pension holidays. We have to make sure we're working to drive down the cost there. We have to continue to ensure that we are driving up the state's credit rating as we're doing by making sure our pension is solvent. So in all of these ways, we can drive down costs for people while taking care of our teachers, our firefighters, our cops, the people in this state who serve us. We now need to make sure we're taking care of them. Tom, the the the governor and the Democrats like to boast about the fact that they've made a full pension payment five years in a row, but while they were making a full pension payment, what they were doing is underfunding the state health care plan. And look what's happened today. It's on the verge of collapse. And employees that work for the state, school districts, municipalities, and counties that are in the state health plan, that includes teachers, are going home with less take-home pay despite getting a 2, three, 4% increase. It's all about priorities. We do not have a short-term liquidity problem when it comes to funding our post-retirement healthcare benefit or a pension. We've got a very long-term solveny problem. The priorities today are the ones that need our attention. And the priorities today for me are property taxes, income taxes, and making sure we get the state health care plan under control because right now it's crushing the middle class that are in that plan. We've got to fund the state healthare plan. Okay. Are did you want What you didn't hear was that he was going to fund your pensions. Final thought. We are going to fund your pension. Anybody that's earned a pension is going to get their pension. But right now, you don't pay if you're in the working right now, you don't pay your grocery or your rent or your mortgage with your pension. If you're working right now, you don't pay your groceries with your pension. You pay it with your net pay. and our public workers are going home with significantly less pay right now because the state health care plan is under siege. It's about to collapse. Okay, we're going to go back over to this side. Our next question is coming to we need to move our camera out of the way for just a minute. Oh, little collision there. It's all good. Oh, O is from Lawrenville and she is a professor here at Ryder University. O okay, and this goes to Jack Chitterelli. All right. Do you plan to add more AI guard rail laws? If yes, what would they be? Very good. Thank you for that question. So, you know, we talk an awful about AI as an economic development opportunity, but what you never hear the governor talk about are the things that concern the public. Social manipulation, job loss. These are two very important considerations that we need to talk about as well. Now, I'm not a computer science expert. I'm not an AI expert, but I tell you what I will do. We're going to sit down with people in the arena in that space and talk about how we protect people from the social manipulation. And I also want to talk about the job loss that comes with AI. Those are the things that have people terribly insecure about this new technology. So I'm going to look to get our state government in the 21st century. We've got in some departments databases that are kept on Excel and in Treasury. I have desktop systems that are on DOSs. DOSs. Now, there's a whole lot of college students here tonight that don't know what the hell doss is, but I get the sense that you do. Okay? This is a dysfunctional state government in so many different ways. So, we need to leverage new technologies by AI, but we also need to know the dangers of AI. And as governor, I will.  Yes, I'm going to put guard rails around AI. Um, we have a change coming and we are not all prepared in the way we should be for it. It's why I'm going to implement the kids online safety act to make sure that our kids are safe. It's why I'm going to make sure that uh when we make some of these countybased schools, they're schools like occupational schools and STEM schools. So, we're pushing into the jobs of the future because we know AI is going to have huge reverberations through the job market. I'm going to make sure that we are changing and addressing our technology here in this state as we move into some of the AI fixes, but also the protections we need for privacy and for people's data. We've already had problems. I have had a family come to me with a deep fake where their daughter's head was put on some pornography in her high school. Imagine that as a teenager. So, we need to do more to put guard rails around AI to protect our kids to ensure we're growing into the jobs of the future and to ensure that we do better by as a state. Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mitchell from Byum. He is a student here at Ryder University. And this question is going to Mikey Cheryl. As someone who is a student teacher currently at Fischer Middle School in Ewing, I'm curious as to what you will do as governor to continue to invest in education in New Jersey given the dismantling of the federal department of education. That's a great question and first of all, thank you. I have a middle schooler, so you're doing the Lord's work. Um, I have to tell you, uh, and they don't always shower as much as they should. So, thank you. Thank you very much. Um, yes, the the dismantling of the Department of Ed is a huge issue. This is one of the ways in which we're seeing a huge hit come into our state budget. It's why I fought so hard to claw to say that we're going to claw back that money. My attorney general is going to sue to claw back as much money from the federal government as we can. We pay $70 billion dollar more into the federal government than we get back as a state. So if they're not going to run their programs, they just need to send that money back so we can run them. And this is a real difference between myself and my opponent who says he doesn't disagree with anything Trump's doing and that he's never going to sue him. So what matters most in a child's education is that teacher, that family who I hope is supporting the teacher and making sure the students doing everything when they get home. You know how difficult it is to teach if parents aren't playing their fulfilling their responsibility and of course that student. And the point I'm trying to make is the farther away you get from the classroom, the less impact I think any governmental institution has on what's taking place in the classroom and student learning. So, I don't necessarily have a problem with the president and the administration downsizing a department of education. Just because they got rid of the department just because they got rid of a department of education doesn't mean they got rid of federal funding. The funding is still coming. Okay? And I'll fulfill my obligation as governor to make sure that our schools are f fully funded. But we need a new public school curriculum to get our kids back on track. And we need more vocational training opportunities. That's what matters most in the acade academic development of our students. Respond. I just want to make sure I correct some misunderstandings up here. Yeah, they did get rid of a lot of federal funding. They got rid of it at every level of education. They got rid of it for funding for our colleges and universities with Pell grants and with research and development funds. They got rid of it when they limited the amount of money you can take on as a student loan to such a small amount that many people now can't go to medical school who thought they were going to medical school. They've limited on for our title one schools that we're seeing. So in almost every level they federal government right now has limited the money that they're sending back to New Jersey for education. And as a state who spends so much money to the federal government, that's offensive. Two things. My attorney general will not be wasting your tax dollars suing the White House every other day. It's a waste of taxpayer dollars. Number two, if we want to if we want to get if we want to get more money out of the federal government, the way to do that is by the governor calling to task our 14 members of our congressional delegation. Two US senators and 12 House members. I'll meet with them every single month to make sure that the 15 of us are working on behalf of New Jersey. That doesn't happen right now. We got the governor and a 14 member delegation, congressional delegation, all run in different directions. They should be together to advocate for New Jersey. Okay. Our next question is going to come, we're going to have to move on with the debate here. Our next question is coming from Charles. Charles is a writer alumni and this is going to Jack Chidarelli first. To make housing more affordable, it's accepted we have to increase its supply. That said, we know that when voters hear more housing, they become concerned about overcrowding schools. Would you support a state bond referendum to give the schools development authority the funding to build new schools throughout the state? No. What I will support is to make sure that government is working in partnership with the private sector to make sure that there's more affordable housing. And by the way, we need to stop right now. Affordable housing is all rental. We need more lease to purchase opportunities. The next generation is doing nothing but renting because that's all we're forcing down their throat. And the reason I say that, Charles, is because I want to stop with us developing highdensity housing in every one of our 564 towns. I want to use the shortage of affordable housing to get people to live in our urban centers again. I live in downtown Somerville. This town has gone through a magnificent transformation because we've gone up with low, moderate, and market rate units, and it's vibrant. What we're doing in Somerville is what we need to do on a much larger scale in Newark, in Trenton, and in Atlantic City. We've got to stop the exacerbation of sprawl. Anybody that's concerned about the environment should not be doing this. And by the way, you want the poster child. Why are we condemning 175y old farm in Cranberry? Why are we condemning open space to build more highdensity housing? I don't think so. So, that's a great question. I I think what we all see here is too much of the money we spend on our education system is not going to the things we want it to go to. So, for example, number one, students, educators, buildings, and we know how necessary it is because I'll tell you, in Montlair, we had the stairway fall in high school. People couldn't go to school for several months. In Patterson, we've had the ceiling fall in elementary school. So, we have some of the oldest school inventory. We have to address it. But unfortunately, so much of the money is going to a bloated administration right now. We need to move that money into the places that we want to address. But you've also raised something about our state that I think is important and that is about how we're going to develop it. And what we really need to do is have a statewide plan to protect our open spaces because many of us know how deeply we really enjoyed them during COVID and how necessary it is for the health and mental wellness wellness. That's why I've been uh a a person at the Great Swamp Gala as I've spoken there about how important open spaces are. So we need to do both develop and have our open spaces preserved. Laura, may we very quickly because we move on to our next question. This is refreshing. I think what she might be saying is we're not going to develop highdensity housing every one of the 564 towns. But the other thing is she didn't answer your question. The answer is no. If we did that, it's only going to exacerbate sprawl. But she didn't answer your question. Again, that's not true. I was very clear on how I think we should spend the money. Okay, we're gonna move on then to Michelle from Byum. She is a parent of a Ryder University student. And Michelle, are you over here or is she over here? Hello, Michelle. How are you? How are you? Okay, Michelle, you have a uh you're a parent of a Ryder student and your question is going to Jack Chidarelli. Hi, Michelle. With Medicaid cuts looming, how will you protect services for people with intellectual developmental disabilities? So, I said before the first job, responsibility of any governor is to provide for the public health and safety. And that certainly applies most of all to our most vulnerable population, our most vulnerable citizens who under Governor Cedarelli will never be underserved. We're going to take care of our citizens, particularly those most in need, and that includes our developmentally disabled. Let's talk about the Medicaid reforms because this is another one of those things that's being lied about in the community. The two big changes in the Medicaid system are these. The reforms are these. You have to verify your eligibility twice a year now, not once a year. Twice a year. Interestingly enough, it was President Barack Obama that put that change in place. President Trump kept it in his first term. Joe Biden put it to once a year. The other thing you have to do with the Medicaid reform is if you're able-bodied and your children are 15 years of age or older, you have to provide us with 20 hours a week in order to continue with Medicaid. 20 hours of what? Volunteerism, education, or work. I think that's reasonable. My opponent doesn't seem to have any issue with people who are scamming the system. If you want the system to endure, we need to save dollars by stopping people from scamming it. I think those two reforms, if you meet those two criteria, which I think are reasonable, guess what? Medicaid doesn't get cut. You continue to have your Medicaid. But as governor, I'll take care of our most vulnerable citizens, and that includes developmentally disabled. You have my word.  Thanks, Michelle. I love that Jack thinks he's going to run the federal delegation when he doesn't understand federal legislation, but we'll save that for another day. This is a question I get from so many parents because they know what's going on with Medicaid and they know the deep funding cuts that are going on that are imperiling many of the programs that support their children. And so that's why as governor, I'm going to make sure my IG is fighting this tooth and nail because here's the truth. I was recently at a federally qualified health center in Camden and I have to tell you traditionally that's been one of the poorest cities in our state. So we were moving away from emergency room care which is both the most expensive kind of care and also the care that goes to charity care in our state budget, not the federal Medicaid dollars. and she was telling me how much their costs were going to go up about 20% more in going through the red tape and bureaucracy that the Trump administration is implementing instead of going to care for people. She said so many of the people are now going to be going back to emergency room care which will be very expensive for the state. I think the fair question of any gubernatorial candidate and obviously that includes my opponent is this. Do you believe it's fair to make somebody have to verify their eligibility for Medicaid twice a year? Do you believe it's fair to continue your Medicaid by giving us 20 hours a week of education, volunteerism, or work if you're able-bodied and your kids are 15 or older? I believe that's fair. You meet that criteria, Medicaid continues. Final thoughts. Thank you, Cheryl. So, it's not about fairness, it's about cost effectiveness. It's about who's going to drive down the cost for the state by making sure we're going into better and cheaper care like in federally qualified health centers or are we going to go back to the bad old days when we're sending everybody to emergency room care which is both worse care and more expensive care. Okay, we have one more question for our audience before we go back to our panel. It is one of our younger members of the audience, Mark. He is an a middle school student from Bridgewater and Mark's question is going to go first to Jack a rally. I'm only 12, but I've already seen one of our US um senators go to prison. What's your vision for restoring public trust in government?  don't.  First of all, congratulations on being here tonight and having the courage to stand up and ask a question. Leadership matters and it starts at the top. So, I've never broken the law. My opponent has. I've never broken the law and so you won't have to worry about they and we'll set the tone for the way that public service ought to be and we'll call out anybody on either side of the aisle that does the wrong thing uh either if they're self-s serving or if they're breaking the law. So, and my attorney general will be very very aggressive in looking at public corruption all up and down the state. But thank you for your question. Thank you so much for your question and you have a great mom bringing you here tonight. So, thank you for being here. Um, you know, I I think this is the key question. And I go around the state and I tell people this is the most nonpartisan race I've run because I think people have lost a lot of faith in both parties. And it's really important right now in this race that here in New Jersey in this state as we're holding the line that we're restoring faith. So that's why I talk a lot about being a Navy helicopter pilot because I think people know what that means. I think they know that I've always served this country and I'm proud of it. I also talk about being a mom because I think that also lets people know why I'm doing this and who I'm fighting for and what I care about. And so I have constantly and consistently listen to as many people as possible to make sure I'm hearing just what it is that people need to sleep at night. How can I, as governor make that a little bit easier? And what I hear is the cost of housing's too high, electricity costs are too high, utility costs are too high. and I want somebody to protect my rights and freedoms and that's what I'll do as governor. We're gonna go back to our panel. Our next question is coming from Micah Rasmusen and that is going to Jack Chitterelli. It's been more than 20 years since the last uh fix DMV. Yet the last I'm sorry, M the last fix DMV. The last fix for DMV. Yet, the agency still has not returned to full in-person service since five years since it's uh now five years after COVID. Uh it's still disenfranchising voters when it botches their motive voter registrations and can't keep up with demand for real IDs. So, what does the fix ID uh fix DMV of 2026 need to look like? So, in any gubernatorial campaign, we're going to end up talking about education reforms and policy, property tax reform and policy, public safety, uh, housing, all the like. But what's easy to overlook is that the state of New Jersey now is a 59 billion dollar enterprise with 60,000 employees, 9.3 million citizen customers, and 1 million business customers, small, medium, and large. And one of the reasons I'm running is because I feel very strongly this state needs a handson CEO governor who's going to show up every damn day and make sure that this state government works for its citizens. You can walk into a DMV office tomorrow in Florida and walk out an hour later with your real ID. Call DMV today in New Jersey for your appointment. They're putting you off until December. I find that embarrassing. I find that embarrassing. So I and my administration will show up every single day and make sure that this state government works on behalf of its citizens. And that means executive order number two. And executive order number two is everyone's coming back to work. They work for us. They work for us. Let's make this state government work for our citizens. You know, this is a difference between myself and my opponent because I am willing to take on anyone, including members of my own party, when it comes to serving the people of New Jersey. He's not. He just serves Trump. But that's why I'll tell you right now that our MVC is not working. It is not working. We were worst in the nation for Real ID. You couldn't get one. People were being told, \"Go get a passport. It'll be quicker.\" And that is the one way in which so many people interact with our government. And so if you're asking how do we build trust in government? How do we rebuild faith in government? We make sure government's working. And so I'm going to make sure the MVC is working for everyone. That you can go and you do most of what you need to do online. You don't always have to go in person. And then when you go in person, you can get an appointment quickly and you can get through the process quickly in and out. That if you need an inspection, you can get your car inspected. And so all of these things are the ways in which almost every person in this state engages with our state government and almost everyone in this state has a really bad story to tell you about it. Not on my watch. I'll fix that as governor. Our next question comes from Sophie Netto Munoz and it goes to Mikey Cheryl. The immigrant trust directive has limited local, county, and state police from assisting in civil immigration enforcement since it was put in place in 2018. If elected governor, would you continue the immigrant trust directive? As governor, I'm going to make sure here in New Jersey, we're following the law and the constitution. And let me tell you a little bit about what's going on right now. I just had a friend talk to a police officer here who had an interaction with somebody who was wearing a mask, who had no idea and was caring. And he walked up to him and said, \"Look, this is my town. What are you doing here?\" And the gentleman said, \"I don't have to tell you.\" And he said, 'You're walking around my town and you do have to tell me.' And he said, 'N no, I don't.' And so the police officer said, 'Well, then I'll take you to jail.' And he said, 'I'll take you to jail.' So he said, 'We'll work it out in jail, but here's the thing. It was an ICE agent refusing to show ID masked. So as governor, I'm going to make sure that people can't go around masked here in our state.  Now, my opponent supports policies where people who are here legally can be detained. Rolling back rights for American citizens, separating children and parents. I'm going to make sure people here in this state are safe and follow the law. Congresswoman, can you clarify? Is that a yes or a no on would you continue the immigrant trust directed? What I'm going to do is make sure we're following the law and the Constitution. So that'll include due process rights and the Constitution. I don't think she answered your question. Executive order number one on day one. We're getting rid of the immigrant trust directive here in New Jersey. I said this back in 2021. I'll say it here again. I've said it every single day. I'm out on the campaign trail. I believe the immigrant trust directive, us having sanctuary cities, us being a sanctuary state, only encourages illegal immigration and restricts our local law enforcement in a number of different ways. The goal here is to keep our community safe. And the best way to do that is us not having sanctuary cities. Let me say something else. My attorney general, unlike the current attorney general, who I think she has said she's considering reappointing, my attorney general will support local law enforcement. We're not getting rid of qualified immunity. She voted to get rid of it in the Congress. We're not doing that. We're going to take the handcuffs off. Let these trained professionals do their job. Flash mobs on our Jersey Shore. Flash mobs in our malls. Breakins, car thefts, nonviolent crime is through the roof. Did anybody see what went down in Saucus 3 weeks ago? Total disregard for law and order. Total disregard for law enforcement. We got to get back to being a law and order state with safe communities. Thank you, Joe.  So, I've served as a federal prosecutor. I've ensured that we're working hard to drive down crime in this state. I've prosecuted people who were criminals here and who were undocumented and they were deported because I care deeply about public safety for the people here and I think we can all agree that violent criminals should be deported. But what I also believe deeply in is due process. the due process rights that are in our constitution. Time is up. And so I'll follow the law and I'll follow the constitution. Getting rid of the immigrant trust directives doesn't mean we're violating your constitutional right to due process. But since she brought up her time as a US attorney, check her record. In the 11 months that she was supposed to be prosecuting cases, she pled most of her cases and people that committed some pretty heinous crimes were allowed to go free. All right, our very last question. So I'll repeat. I'm very proud of my prosecutorial record. I worked really hard to take illegal guns off the street to make sure our streets were safe. Jack has never served in law enforcement. He's never served to keep this country safe. I have and I'll continue to do that. One more question of this evening and it comes from David Wildstein. David David Wildstein has a fa uh final question and it goes first to Jack Chitterelli. Laura, I'm going to throw you a little bit of a curveball. You're throwing me Oh, you're asking more than one question. He's a baseball fan. Yeah, it happens. So, so is it a question for me? A closing question. Oh, you had a closing question. But, uh, there's a a man here named Tom who came to ask a question who, quite frankly, his question is more important than mine. I'd like to give him my time. Oh, you want to go back to Tom? I want to go to Tom. I don't I can go to Tom. Hold on. We had two Toms. Let me go back. Ah, sorry. Okay. So, Tom, I'm gonna go back to you. And I don't have my Q card. So, Tom, I am also a Tom from Princeton. So I I Yes, there is two to two toss from Princ. Thank you both for doing this. Let's see you do more of this, please. Uh who am I interested? Oh, so this is going to go first to Jack Chidarelli. Jack, please describe New Jersey's current state of care for residents with severe and persistent mental illness, the reasons why it is so, and your proposals as governor to address it. So Tom, I would like to do more of this. Uh by law, we have to do two. Uh CBS News out of New York invite us to a third. I agreed. My opponent did not. Uh let me say this. We know we have a mental health crisis and I'm proud of what we did in Somerset County. We created the first public private partnership and it was a 247 community mental health center because we saw what was going on in the community and people could not get access convenient access to highquality mental health services. So we actually employed in county government in New Jersey psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social workers. people had a place to go. It didn't matter what your coverage was. You got quality service. As governor, there are two things we should not be approaching 564 towns at a time. I think our state, our county governments across the state are underappreciated and underleveraged. We'll put a plan in place the state will fund for there to be a community mental health center in every one of our 21 counties and a homeless shelter. We need that here and you can't expect us to address that 564 towns at a time. So, I think we need to use the Somerset County model to provide for community mental health clinics all across New Jersey so people have convenient access to highquality mental health services. Tom, thanks for raising this question because as I've sort of mentioned already tonight, we have a mental health crisis. We have a loneliness crisis. I see it in our kids. I see it in seniors. I see it across this state. people who aren't connecting anymore. And so that's why this is so important and we need to add resources. I've added federal resources to the Mental Health Association of Morrison Essex. I'll continue to work hard to fund the different programs that we have. uh making sure that we also put in place things like red flag laws so people like many of our veterans who are contemplating suicide uh can be protected by those and keep those red flag laws as the courts attack them and people like Jack Chidarelli vote against them. I'll also make sure that as we have our police officers going out, we use the Verrive Together program. In talking to so many of our police officers, they don't have the tools or the training sometimes to handle some of the most egregious mental health problems and it often creates really bad outcomes. Thank you, Tom. The one other thing that we need to do and I will instigate as a member of the National Governor's Association, I think it's long overdue, it's time for us to get rid of the Medicaid reimbursement rates. Community physicians will tell you off the record they won't see Medicaid patients, many of which have mental health issues. We need to start reimbursing at one rate, the Medicare rate. Community physicians find that acceptable. They do not find the Medicaid rate acceptable. So, let's work together with our congressional delegation, the other 49 governors to start reimbursing at one rate. Let's move everybody into Medicare, one rate, which community physicians find acceptable, and people have better access as well. Tom, you're really on the hot feet. Um, but I think what we also need to do is add money to housing. Um, many mental health professionals will say what you first need to do is stabilize people in housing and have wraparound services from there. Thanks. All right, that concludes our question and answer time. It is time now to go to closing statements. Each candidate has 30 seconds. Our first candidate going for our closing statements. That is going to go to Mikey Cheryl. You have 90 seconds. Well, thank you so much everybody. I really appreciate it. Uh, this has been a great debate and I think you've heard some clear differences here. I've served this country my entire life. As I mentioned, helicopter pilot, prosecutor, member of Congress, and mom of four great kids, I'm going to continue to serve this state because I want to drive down your costs. So whether it's utility cost or housing cost or energy cost, you've heard again and again and again, I have a plan to drive down your cost. Jack's going to go a lot in lock step with Washington as he drive as Trump drives up your energy costs. So at every level I'll continue to work for you and at every level he'll raise your costs like he's done at every level of government with taxes. So I really appreciate all of you coming out tonight to hear about this. This has been a great evening and thank you once again New Jersey. I appreciate it. You have 90 seconds. You have 90 seconds. The Cheddarellis have been here for a hundred years. Three generations of Chedarellis have all achieved their American dream right here in New Jersey. My grandfather started out in the ditch as a laborer, saved his nickels and dimes, became a very successful independent contractor. My parents were successful restaurant bar owners, but that wasn't their only job. My mom worked midnights on the line for J&J. My dad was in the street department for public service gas. Every dime they made went to their family. the roof over our head, clothes on our back, meal on a table, and our public school education. I followed in my grandparents and parents' footsteps. I'm a two-time successful business owner here in the state of New Jersey, having created jobs. I've also had the privilege of serving at every level of government, municipal, county, and legislation legislature, terminating myself each time, not taking the salary of the benefits at the at the municipal or county level. I'm an MBA CPA. No candidate has ever come before you with that resume. And so I'm committed to fixing our state. When something I love is broken, I want to fix it. I believe leadership matters. I believe that we can fix the state of New Jersey or I wouldn't be asking you for your consideration. We can do this. But I want you to know this. Unlike governors on both sides of the aisle over the last 40 years, I'm not using this to get to Washington. This is my final destination. When my four or eight years are over, you'll find me at the beach in Surf City. Okay? But I'll give you four or eight years of the best years of my life and we'll work in partnership with the legislature and we'll get things done and we'll fix the state of New Jersey. Thank you very very much.",

She was so excited about getting us all together tonight. For the past three and a half weeks, I've gotten four texts a day, and some of them come at 3 o' clock in the morning. That video that you played, I know, means a whole lot to each and every one of us, but my son's an army captain right now over in The Middle East. So when I see those military personnel in that video, really makes me feel good about what my son is doing. But I know we have a number of veterans here today, so let them stand up and let's recognize them for their contribution to our country. There they are. There they are, men and women. As I always like to say, no people achieves greatness, and no great country of great people endures without those who are willing to sacrifice. We thank you all for your service. I've got some really great news to you. For you, rather. In 43 days. In 43 days, we're winning this election. I'm telling you right now, we're going to win. Because the campaign is all about positive energy. It's all about a message that unites, doesn't divide. And it's all about people, not power or politics. And there are positive signs everywhere. Number one, we're out fundraising. Our opponent, that's a very good sign. Number two, my opponent's lying about me. That's usually the first sign of defeat. But another great sign is the fact over the last five weeks, three Democratic mayors across this state have endorsed my candidacy for governor. The first moon came about five weeks ago in Dover in Morris County. Now, what I really like about that, it's the heart of the legislative district of my opponent, right in the heart of her district, the Dover of Morris county endorsed me. A couple weeks ago, we were up in Bergen county, and the mayor of Bergen in Bergen County, Garfield, the fifth largest town in our most populated county, endorsed me. And two minutes after he endorsed me, he changed his party affiliation to Republican. I like that, too. And this past weekend, we were up in Branchville in Sussex county, and there the mayor endorsed me as well. But the most fun I've had was back in Dover when that mayor endorsed me. It was at a big cheddar rally for governor rally. We were at this cafe restaurant and in walked this woman to get something from the cafe, not realizing she had just walked into a cheddar rally for governor rally. When she realized what she had done, she came on over to me and she was a little defiant. She put her finger up. She said, I just want you to know something. Mikey Sherrill is my congresswoman, and I like the job that she's doing representing me in Washington, D.C. and I said, well, ma', am, that's why I'm here. You vote for me, I'll make sure she stays. You're a congresswoman. There was a pregnant pause, and then she looked up at me and Said, I think I might like you. I said, well, that's the whole point here. But listen, when those Democratic mayors endorse me, and that woman says that, and that's a true story, by the way. I'm telling you as I go all around the state, people want change. Ethel said it. People want change. I'm not just talking about Republicans. Talking about unaffiliated, independent, moderate Democrats all across the state. People have had it with eight years of Phil Murphy's failed policies. And they know my opponent is Murphy 2.0. Did anybody watch the debate last night? The woman refuses to answer a question. Refuses to answer a question, but she'll continue to lie about me. So let's get one thing straight. Anybody here thinks that I'm going to raise your sales tax to 10%, I got a bridge I want to sell you for about a buck, okay? We're not raising taxes. What's interesting about that is when she was asked, are you going to raise taxes? She said, you know what? I'm going to be fiscally responsible. I'm not going to commit myself to anything. So wait a second. You're lying about me raising taxes. But then when you're asked, you said you could possibly. We're not raising anybody's taxes. We all know we're the most overtaxed people in the country. What we are going to do over the next 43 days is Tell the World, New Jersey, who my opponent really is. She supported all of Joe Biden's open border policies, every one of his open border policies. She. She approved his inflationary policies. She voted no on the Lake and Riley Act. Now, let me see if I get this. He came here illegally. Crime number one. And while you're here, you broke the law. Crime number two, we're not going to detain and deport and incarcerate you. She voted no on that bill. This mother of two daughters voted yes twice to allow biological boys to play in girls sports. That's one of those 80, 20 issues here, right, Sean? In New Jersey, more than eight out of 10 people don't approve of that. Here in New Jersey, she supports sanctuary cities and us being a sanctuary state. This is somebody that was fined for breaking federal law on stock trades and stock reporting. Somebody. The New York Times reports. The New York Times that while sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she was trading defense stocks. She endorsed Mondame, the socialist Democrat out of New York, and he's endorsed her. Okay? And she voted no on the big beautiful bill. Now, let's think about what this bill does particularly for New Jerseyans. Number one, it allows you now to deduct $40,000 of property taxes on your federal tax return. It doubles the child care tax credit for families with young children. It doesn't tax tips, Social Security, overtime. And if you send your kids to private school, it provides a magnificent tax credit for those who send their kids to private school. She voted no on that bill. What does that tell you? She's not about New Jersey. And here's why. We've seen this before. They brought John Corzine here from Illinois. That didn't work out so well. They brought Phil Murphy here from Massachusetts. This hasn't worked out so well. She's not from New Jersey. So I got a really simple idea. How about we elect the Jersey guy? Let's elect the Jersey guy. The other good news, we were in the poll this last. This past week for three days of polling. Three weeks ago, we had it a dead heat. This most recent poll, I'm up by one point. So we're right where we need to be. The White House has done the same, and the White House has me up by one point as well. So we're in really good shape as we go about our business here. But we're going to tell people what we're going to do. And here's what happens on day one of my administration, when I'm your governor. Executive order number one. No town in this state will be a sanctuary city, and we will not be a sanctuary state. Okay? That question was asked last night. She wouldn't answer the question. I came right out and said, we're getting rid of the Immigrant Trust directive. It only encourages illegal immigration and makes the job of our local law enforcement harder. Executive order number two. We're bringing back to work our state workers. Phil Murphy's got them working from home. Post pandemic. Have you tried getting somebody on the phone? Have you tried getting your issue resolved? I find this embarrassing. You can go into a DMV office in Florida today and walk out an hour later with your real id. Call New Jersey Division of Motor Vehicles today for your real id. They're giving you an appointment in December. That's embarrassing to me. This statement, this government needs to work on behalf of its people. We're bringing people back to work. Also on day one, I give you an attorney general that supports both police and parents here in the state of New Jersey. So what does that mean exactly? What it means is my attorney general is going to support me in getting rid of cashless bail Cashless bail has created the professional criminal who's learned how to game the system. Talk to your local cops. Arrest, release, repeat is real. You want safe communities. Stop letting criminals go free. Let police do their job. How will that Attorney General support parents? Sean knows on day one, we get rid of policy 5756. We're not keeping secrets from parents in our schools. The notion of keeping secrets from parents is immoral. It's indecent, it's wrong, it's dangerous. It ends on day one of my administration. And speaking about what's going on in our schools, I said this last night. My opponent has come out loud and clear. She supports biological boys playing in female sports. She supports the LGBTQ curriculum in our schools. Now, listen, I'm a live and let live guy. I'm all about a welcoming, inclusive environment. But right is right, wrong is wrong. She not only supports the LGBTQ curriculum, worse, what she has said is she won't as governor, she will not allow parents to opt out of that class lesson. That's wrong. That's wrong. First of all, there won't be an LGBTQ curriculum when I'm your governor. Okay? Now, New Jersey is the most diverse state in the country, and I believe what we should do with our K12 students is talk about our diversity. But we don't necessarily have to talk specifically to any one minority group. Otherwise, why are we excluding the others? I think that's the right thing to do, and here's how we'll accomplish that. On day one of my administration, you'll get a whole new state board of education. We're getting back to basics and teaching a critical life skills, providing vocational training with an age appropriate curriculum that respects parental rights. Also, on day one of my administration, you get a whole new energy master plan. What does that mean exactly? We're getting rid of the electrical vehicle mandate in this state. That's coming up real soon. The Democratic governor of Delaware just got rid of their EV mandate. I'm never telling you what car you have to buy. I'm not telling you how to heat your home. I'm not telling you what appliance you have to buy. There'll be no wind farms off our Jersey shore. We'll expand natural gas. We'll expand nuclear. Okay. We'll have a rational transition to the future. We're also going to pull out of Reggie on day one of my administration. What does that mean? The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a carbon tax policy. And by pulling out, I save half a billion dollars a year. For ratepayers, homeowners, tenants and business on day one, the plan that my opponent has put forth to declare a state of emergency and freeze your property taxes, number one, there are 77. Right, Brian? 77 Democratic legislators today. Not one of them has said that's a good idea. Mr. Governor, why don't you do that? You know why? Because it's illegitimate, it's illegal, and it's not feasible. And by the way, why would you want to freeze rates at their all time highest level? We want to get them down. We want to get them down. So it's not a real plan. But I think here's the best part about my new energy master plan. Ann Baker, where are you? At the supermarket. You can have back your plastic bags. Now, if any of you saw the trunk of my car for the number of times I forgot to bring in those bags and had to buy three more of those bags, you probably wouldn't vote for me. You know what I love, Ethel, about the plastic bag policy? I could say I'm going to lower taxes and I get a nice little round of applause. I say I'm bringing back the plastic bags. It brings down the house every single time. We are going to reduce the size and cost of our state government to afford a tax cut for business and individuals. Our businesses are the highest tax nation, as are our individuals. You already heard what we're going to do on public safety. You already heard what we're going to do on public education. A great many of our suburban communities are getting overdeveloped with this Mount Laurel housing doctrine. We're going to stop the overdevelopment of our suburban communities. We're not putting high density housing in every one of our 564 towns. And on day one, I go before our state supreme court with a new argument with regard to school funding. You're all getting screwed. Your communities do not get their fair share of state aid to schools. We'll fix that on day one with a new state school funding formula. So I'm excited, guys, about what we can accomplish right here. Now, here's how it goes down for the next 43 days. Get ready. She's going to remind you every single day. My opponent will that she's a woman. So Ethel's asked me to remind all of you I'm a man. Ethel asked for that personally. She's going to tell you every single day. She's a mother of four. I'm going to tell you every day. I'm a father of four. She's going to tell you she's an attorney. I'm here to tell you I'm a cpa. She's going to tell you she knows how to run a helicopter. I'm here to tell you in this house of worship, she doesn't know a damn thing about running the state of New Jersey. I'm telling you right now. So we're going to get this done, and I'm now going to ask you. This is called the call to action. You know what I'm going to do over the next 43 days? I'm going to get up and down this state, 564 towns, all 21 counties North, Central, south and Jersey Shore, and all 600 diners. I visited one on the way here, okay? That's where you get up close and personal with New Jerseyans. They'll tell you straight up how you're doing over their BLT or their omelette, okay? But I'm going to do that every single day. And yes, there is a Central Jersey. I live in it, okay? I just want you all to know there is a Central Jersey. But here's what I need you to do. Every single one of you has a sphere of influence. Don't ever underestimate the power of the personal testimonial. Over the course next 43 days, tell people what's at stake. Now, you're never going to hear me say this is the most important election of our lifetime. I believe that every election is equally important for different reasons. But I will tell you this. The future of our state hangs in the balance. I'm looking around the group here. I'm 64 this year, and you all seem. There's people younger than me here with small children. I see them, but everyone else seems kind of my age group. Have you ever seen things out this bad as it is today in this state? Have you ever seen it as bad as it is today? They broke it. They own it. They've controlled the legislature for 25 years. They've held the governorship for the past eight years. This is their policies that got us to where we are today. So when I started out at the very beginning saying that we're going to win this year, I wasn't just talking about me back in 2021, with me at the top of the ticket and a little bit of wind in our face, we flipped 134 seats at the municipal and county level, over 200 board of education seats. And I know we have board of education here today. And we flipped eight seats in the state legislature, including beating the longest sitting state senate president of the country. Guess what? We got some wind at our back now. And with that wind at our back, I'm telling you, we could flip at least 13 seats. Pastor, what's the significance of 13 seats? We get the 41. What's the significance of 41? We get something we haven't had in 25 years. A Republican majority in our state legislature. And that agenda that I laid out for you earlier today will be much easier to accomplish when we get that. Now, if we by chance we don't, just hypothetically, because we're going to do it. But if by chance we don't, all is not lost by state constitution. Your governorship is the most powerful in the nation. That's a fact. I appoint the supreme court justices. I get to do two, one of which will be the chief justice. I get to appoint the attorney general. I get the 21 county prosecutors. I appoint superior court judges. I get line item veto in the budget. That's just the beginning of all the leverage I have if I have a legislature that doesn't want to cooperate with me. But let me say something, because I know a whole lot of people here are part of the pro life movement that Ethel leads. Let me say a couple things when I'm governor. Number one, we're not going to celebrate abortion. The current administration celebrates abortion, which I find kind of sick. Number two, we're not making New Jersey the abortion capital of New Jersey. Have you heard their policy? What have they said? Sean, if you can't get it done in Mississippi, come to New Jersey. And worse yet, we'll pay for it. We're not making New Jersey the abortion capital. We're not inviting anybody here to perform abortion, let alone us pay for it. I appreciate that. And the millions of dollars that they have given to Planned Parenthood. Why is it they never give a penny to our pregnancy resource centers like Lighthouse or others that works with women. Right. To carry the pregnancy to term. Right. Those are some of the things that we're gonna do. But the thing that I feel strongest about, which I wish we had an opportunity to point out more in last night's debate, but we will at the next one. You know, in this state, nobody can get their ears pierced under the age of 18 without parents permission. And yet 15 and 16 year olds can go for abortion, not notify their parents there's something terribly wrong. I've yet to find the most liberal woman in the state that agrees with that policy. And I'm telling You here now. When I'm your governor, I'm going to fight like hell, and I'll appoint Supreme Court justices that support us when it comes to parental notification. So with that gang, I can't thank you enough. I wish I could spend the whole evening with you. Ethel's been so accommodating. We've got one more stop after this one, including a call with the White House. The president's very in tune. And the most fun we had during the primary was when I was about to go into a town hall like this and my phone was in my back pocket and it would not stop ringing. Every time it went in the voicemail, you could tell they hung up and redialed. And so finally my staff came over to me and said, you need to take that call. I said, well, who the heck is it? He said, it's Air Force One, so maybe I should take that call, Brian. I went outside. It was Deputy White House Chief of Staff James Blair. I said, james, what's up, buddy? Jack, we're on our way to Saudi Arabia for the investment forum. The president wants to talk to us. Well, put it on. Jack, how you doing? I'm great, Mr. President. How are you? He says, great. How are things in New Jersey? I said, Mr. President, great. I told you we're going to win this thing. He said, I know you are. I know you are. I said, you know, best wishes on the investment forum in Saudi Arabia. Congratulations on the tariff negotiations at the time with uk, China and India. He said, oh, Jack, it's going great. He said, I know we talked about this a few months ago, but I just been so busy. I said, Mr. President, you're the president. I know you're busy. He said, well, I told you then a couple months ago I was going to endorse you. I'm ready now. I said, hey, Mr. President, I'm ready when you are. And then he said, jack, this is the most beautiful endorsement. There are so many nice things in here about you. I wrote every one of them. You're going to love it. And as soon as we hang up, I'm going to hit the send button. I said, Mr. President, I'm honored. As soon as we hung up, he hit the send button. All hell broke loose around the state. It's great to have the endorsement of the president of the United States. He wants to win, and he knows we can win. So before I wrap it up here, a couple things I want you to know about me. The Ciatarellis have been here for 100 years, three generations of Ciatarellis will all achieve their American dream right here in New Jersey. My grandfather started out in the ditch, saved his nickels and dimes, became a very successful independent contractor. My parents, restaurant bar owners, no two people worked harder. My mother worked midnights on the line for J and J. My dad worked in the street department for Public Service Gas. Mom worked midnight. She ran the restaurant bar by day. Dad worked by day, he ran the restaurant bar by night. And every dime they made went to their four kids. Roof over our head, clothes on our back, meal on a table. In our public school education, and then I was the only one of the four that went to Seton Hall. My parents reminded us every single day, my three siblings and me, of our responsibilities to each other, to our family, our community and our country. Our responsibilities. They also reminded us that house. In that house, the four of us had no rights. We all got one right at the age of 18, the right to leave. My mother was four' 11 on a good day, not 100 pounds. My sister was a saint. My three brothers and I could raise a little around the house. The woman never once said, wait till your father gets home. Ever. There was a drawer in the kitchen. Out came the wooden spoon. One time she broke it on my brother and I was laughing. She got another one, took it out on me. I turned out okay, didn't I? I was working the boardwalk late in the summer and I saw a guy walking along with a T shirt that said, I survived the wooden spoon. I went and got that vote. I went and got that vote. I followed in my grandparents and parents footsteps and I'm a two time successful business owner. When people ask me why you're running for governor, it's really quite simple. My parents believed in the American dream and in the promise, opportunity. People don't feel so confident today, particularly here in New Jersey. Here's what people are fearful of, if not insecure about, right? The education of dreams, job of the dreams. Raise a family here, start a business here, retire here. These are all the things that people are fearful of today. That's not the state I want to be governor of. I believe leadership matters. I believe leadership will make a difference. And when something I love is broken, I want to fix it. This state is broken and together we can fix this state. I'm telling you right now, it's all about the leadership. But you don't have to worry about me getting distracted. Number one, I don't need the job. We've all been very fortunate. So I don't need the job. And I mean that with the utmost humility. But make no mistake, I want the job. On your behalf. On our behalf. I want this job. Number two, I'm not owned by any special interests. The current governor is owned by the teachers union leadership, state workers, Garden State equality. He's owned. My opponent is, too. Once your governor is owned, they're compromised. And once they're compromised, it's over. They won't be able to make the hard decisions or do the right things in Trenton. But the last thing I want you to know, most importantly to me, unlike governors on both sides of the aisle, over the last 40 years in the state, every single one of them has used this position to get to Washington. This is my final destination. After four or eight years, whatever you decide to give me, I'm going to the beach in Surf City. Okay. I've been asked to run for Congress. Answer always has been, always will be no. I've been asked to run for U.S. senate. Answer has been, will continue to be no. Ethel has not asked me to run for president. But the answer is no. And something else, Tom. I don't want to write a book. I just want to write the ship. So together, let's get this done. The theme for this campaign is it's time. Let's get this done, guys. It's time. 43 days. 43 days. All gas, no break. Let's get this done. Great to be with you. Thank you so much.}",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 23 - Sherrill speech in Atlantic City, Second Baptist Church This is a really important election. And you know, I was just on a small business walk with some of you and we were going to a couple restaurants down the street and I was talking to Sirill and I was talking to Mike about the restaurants and you know I was asking them how it was going and they said not great. They can already feel the impacts of what Trump has done to the economy. And you know, I was saying to them, well, what is it? Is it food prices? And they were saying, it's everything. It's food. It's utensils. It's the containers that we give out. It's every level. Prices have gone up. We're going to have a $5 billion hole in the state budget of New Jersey because of the one big beautiful bill. Somebody's making money when people across New Jersey, small business owners, large business owners, you and me is where purchasing things are paying a bunch of money for these tariffs that Trump has put in place. And I know who it is. I know who it is. When Donald Trump and his kids have made $3 billion minimum over the last 9 months, what does it take to make $3 billion? I'll tell you what it takes. It takes holding hostage the economy of the United States and saying, “Look, if you want access to our market, you're going to pay into my cryptocurrency. You're going to enrich me and my family as I take money out of the pockets of the people.” I am declaring a state of emergency on utility costs and I am freezing right I'm going to beef up the firsttime home buyers program because right now it's too low and we know what the average cost of a house is here and we also know what it's going to take to build generational wealth in families. It is extremely important. And I'm going tell you, if some of you are even thinking voting that way, it's a lost vote. Because they say you get what you vote for and you also get what you don't vote for. >> Because if we stay home, that's a vote for the other side. It is extremely important that we support Mikey Cheryl. >> Yes, >> it is extremely important because her values align with ours and she's made a commitment to the urban centers here in New Jersey. This is incredibly important. This is not a simple election that we're talking about. We're talking about uh in less than a year 300,000 African-American women lost their jobs. >> That's right. We talking We're talking about the the unemployment rate in our community rising, >> not going in the other direction, but in the wrong direction. We're talking about them removing people uh from museums. We're talking about them banning books. We talking about them taking away Medicaid and health care from working families for giving the the multi- rich and the multinational wealthy and rich in this country huge tax breaks at the expense of working women's children. Right? This is what we're talking about. Them attacking education, them attacking opportunity, and them being blatant about it in public because they think you can't do anything about it. Why? Because they control both houses of Congress. Because they control the presidency. because they have a Supreme Court that has made him the king. >> This this is what's happening. And at the same time still trying to gerrymander and redistrict to get your vote to mean less and less and less to steal the midterm elections right before your very eyes. And we're looking when they came for the Jews, I didn't speak out because I wasn't a Jew. When they came for the labor unions, I didn't speak out because I wasn't in the labor union. And when they came for me, there was nobody left to speak out. >> And that's where we are. We in a situation where we have to speak out. All of us collectively and together have to say something about what's going on. And the problem is we use fear as strategy. We think we we rationalize to ourselves that we're being strategic when we should just say we scared. Because if we just admitted the fact that we're afraid to lose the little bit we got, we're afraid to lose the little bit we have. We'll be the first generation that's afraid to sacrifice for our children like our grandmothers and grandfathers sacrifice for us. Why you wouldn't even be able to sit in this church with each other like this. If it wasn't for fights your grandmother and grandfather have, you wouldn't be able to uh elect a woman to be the governor of the state of New Jersey. If it wasn't for women's liberation movement and people fighting and organizing across this country, you want to be",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 25 - Ciattarelli on Squawk Box New poll out this morning from uh from Emerson College WPIX channel 11 and the Hill. If this was Drudge, if I was Drudge, it would say shock poll because it has the race for New Jersey governor between Democrat Mikey Cheryl and Republican Jack Chedarelli tied tied 11% undecided. Joining us this morning uh with his plans for New Jersey, Republican gubanatorial candidate Jack Chedarelli. I said shock. Well, maybe um uh maybe you're not shocked, but uh that was a pleasant surprise for you this morning. No, you're you're shaking your head. What do you attribute it to? Uh can I should I call you Jack or Chad? Because I know Chad's your nickname. Is that that goes all the way back to a place in a town in Italy, doesn't it? >> You've uh you've done your homework and people that call me Chad know the correct pronunciation of the last name is Chedarelli. So, but Joe, listen. You call me whatever you want, but I'm not shocked one bit by that poll. It's very consistent with what we've seen in internal polling for weeks, and it's very consistent with what I see up and down the state. In the last 5 weeks alone, three Democratic mayors have even endorsed my candidacy. People want change. >> Police unions, other unions, uh things that didn't happen last time, I'm I'm told by by someone I told you my son follows New Jersey. You can't believe it. But um what happened with the police? Didn't that just happen? That that was that unexpected? Uh, not really. Uh, the current attorney general has been the most politically motivated and most anti- police we've ever had in our 238-year history. And my opponent has said at times that she's willing to consider reappointing him. And uh, she's done another a number of other things that are very anti- police and that includes her endorsement of Mandami and Mandami endorsing her. Uh, police are looking for a change as as are many other professions. >> She endorsed Mandami. >> She did. >> I didn't didn't realize I was wondering what you attribute it because you've closed the gap and the last time you ran it was much closer than anyone thought and I think Trump lost he wouldn't he would say he didn't lose but I think Trump lost what do you lose New Jersey by by double digits this time how much did he lose by because how much did you you cut it to what uh the last election um >> I lost by three points in 21 uh Trump 20 compared to 24 in New Jersey was a 10point improvement ment that's the largest improvement in the country of the 50 states. So no, he didn't win New Jersey, but the fact that he improved by 10 points says that her strategy is a total failure. She's blaming everything in New Jersey that's wrong with our state and as a result of the 25-y year reign of the Democrats and the legislature and eight years of Phil Murphy. She's blaming everything on Donald Trump. And uh he's got nothing to do with our property taxes, nothing to do with the failure of our public schools, nothing to do with the spike in non-violent crime because the way we've handcuffed our cops, nothing to do with overdevelopment, and nothing to do with our rising electricity rates. Well, you have uh he's he's endorsed you and and you have not run from from his endorsement that I I'm not sure what that uh you know, New Jerseyy's tough uh uh Jack and and um that's all she's that's all I've seen her say is that you're like you like Trump and that's supposed to be enough to vote for her. Why do you think the gap is closed? I saw some of the debate. Um, but I've also seen that ad that you've got where um it's just a simple question that that I don't know where you found that that tape. Has that been consistent where you ask her what would what would what would you do? And really it made Kamla look like like you know the most eloquent person in the world compared to what what I saw what you what you're running on your ads. I I know that sounds like a free ad for you, but we're going to we've asked her to come on. she can come on and say, you know, counter all of this stuff, but that outtake is like embarrassing. >> Joe, she has not only disqualified herself in a number of ways, and we go through this, but she's also proving she's not qualified for the position. Uh, even during the debate last Sunday, there were some very direct questions she refuses to answer, and it has to do with the fact that she's pandering to the far-left element of her party, uh, while still not trying to upset certain people. Uh, answer the question. I think the people of New Jersey deserve that. But we've also seen her ducking joint campaign appearances time and time again all throughout New Jersey here. So, I don't know if she's trying to run out the clock. You got to press the flesh to win an election in Jersey. It's what I do every day. >> Well, that's why you're I guess that's why you're not here cuz I wanted you to come in and sit on set. It's usually better. You won't even cross a bridge because uh and you you don't have any uh national aspect. This is this is all this is it for you. You want to run New Jersey and fix New Jersey. What are the most important things that that New Jersey needs right now? >> Joe, I promise you I'll come into the studio next time. As much as I hate that congestion, the >> election's coming up. I can't have you on. We We can't have you on every week. Uh we got to have Mikey Cheryl on hopefully and and then we could we'll we'll make it sort of a you know, we're Go ahead. Becky's from New Jersey. She cares. You care about it, >> Jack? I do. What do you What do you think's broken in New Jersey right now? What do you want to change? >> Number one, we've got the highest property taxes in the nation. Number two, our electricity rates are going through the roof. Uh, number three, our public education system's failing. We've slipped from 2 to 12 on a national report card. Nonviolent crime is spiking. Breakins, car thefts, flash mobs because we've handcuffed our police and because of cashless bail. And in our suburban communities, we're overdeveloping them, taking garden right out of the Garden State. These are the things that everybody's so damn angry about. And so, we go out. >> How do you fix Let's just go at this education because I care about this one a lot. How do you fix education if you're also doing it while lowering property taxes? because property taxes are what pay for the schools in our state. >> Fixing education is all about changing the curriculum. We got to get back to basics in teaching critical life skills, reading, writing, math, and providing vocational training opportunities. We've gotten away from that. We've watered down the curriculum with a whole bunch of things that I believe belong at home at the kitchen table between parents and their children. And that starts on day one when I replace everybody at the state board of education. We also need a high impact curriculum. While we were slipping from 2 to 12 on the national report card, Louisiana went from 48 to 32. If your kid is behind grade level in reading, writing, math, we're going to spend the entire next marking period doing nothing other than reading, writing, and math. I'm a data guy as an NBA CPA. The data is clear. If somebody comes out of eighth grade, not on grade level, they'll be undermployed their entire life. >> Yeah, 100%. I no argument on that. But what what are the superolous things you get rid of? I mean, I have kids in the public school system. >> Well, here's a big difference. Um, my opponent says she's keeping the LGBTQ curriculum and she will not let parents opt out of those lessons. Now, I'm all for an inclusive environment in >> our school. >> I'm all for an inclusive environment. I'm all for a welcoming environment. Uh, but I don't think we need that in our public schools. I also think that we're teaching sex education at too young a grade. Um, explicit sex acts to 12-year-olds, gender ID and sexual orientation in kindergarten. Um, parents don't approve of that. It's one of the number one issues in this campaign. >> What's the the uh I've had Phil Mur we've had Phil Murphy on more than a few times. What do the finances look like right now? I I always whenever he's on I say I think Florida's zero. Where where's he got there's a millionaire? Didn't he do a millionaire tax too? Is it uh I if you are it's 11 what is it? What's the state income tax? He's raised it to what? And then what additional uh taxes are are uh are on New Jerseyians? Joe, we've got some very progressive steep tax rates in New Jersey going as high as 11%. And our next door neighbor, Pennsylvania, has a 3% flat tax. Pennsylvania is lowering their business tax from 10 to 5. The Democrats in Trenton, with the support of my opponent, raised our business tax from 9 to 11 12, the highest in the nation. How hell are we going to grow our economy with that kind of tax structure? Not to mention that we're a regulatory intensive state that now has some of the highest electricity rates in the country and that affects business. Trump's trying to bring manufacturing back to the country. You think they're coming to New Jersey with these kind of electricity rates? I can lower those rates on day one. >> Um, are you sure it's a formal endorsement from Mum D? We're trying to find that and we can't find it. Uh Jack, >> he did a news uh he was on one of the news shows out of New York recently. They asked him, he said, \"I endorse her. I've called on her to reject that.\" >> She endor No, she endorsed him. >> Yes, we could show you that clip. She said, \"If he's the nominee, I guess I endorse him.\" >> Said it said it like that. Where did she get the Do you want a 10% uh sales tax? Cuz she the ad she's running is a is a tape of you saying I want a 10% sales tax. I will tax everything. I mean, it it it sounds like your voice. What What were you talking about at that point? >> We were at a town hall, Joe. And by the way, we're not raising the sales tax. I'm lowering property taxes and lowering income taxes. And I've given very specifics on how to do that. It's a blatant lie just like it is with the powerful special interests that are telling public workers. >> But I hear But I hear you saying it. How did they find It's not AI, is it? >> No. No. It was at a town hall and someone said to me, \"Jack, I don't understand the math. We've got the highest property taxes, the highest business tax, one of the highest income taxes, and we also have a pretty abundant sales tax. What What's going on? What do other states do? And so, we had a larger conversation about the fact that Florida has no income tax. It relies on tourism. Pennsylvania has a 3% flat tax. And I said, I just came back from Tennessee. They've got no income tax. They've got a 10% sales tax on everything. A 10% sales tax on everything. That's what I said about Tennessee. They took that clip, cut and pasted it in the commercial and trying to lead people to believe that I want to raise the sales tax in New Jersey to 10%. It’s a blatant lie.",

    "transcript_text": "Sep 26 - Sherrill interview on Meidas Touch https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=Iku-nfraDKA Yeah. So, it's we found out about it because a journalist came forward and said, you know, Jack Chidarelli's team is has your personnel record and they shouldn't have it. >> Um, they tried to give it to me and I I, you know, I looked at it and they shouldn't have all this stuff. Your social security is in there. So, he, you know, we got in touch with him. Um, shortly thereafter, I think we got a letter from the archives alerting us to this data breach that was inappropriate. So then we got to work digging through exactly what happened. And what we've pieced together is that um, my primary was June 10th. So on June 9th, uh somebody working with Chidurelli, somebody who Chitterelli had vetted as his lieutenant governor, so someone you know in connection with him and someone who by the way is a former military officer, should have known better, um foyed my military records and was told that uh he did not have access to them, that they were privileged, you know, confidential information, um personal identifying information, PII type stuff, and he didn't have access and he needed to get my permission to release him. So on June 10th, I went shortly thereafter, he makes a phone call and I'm he said he c got in touch with a real helpful person. So this real helpful person um who he got in touch with ended up releasing all my documents and even this guy said I was you know it was kind of shocking and I was shocked and disgusted that I got this because it had a lot of like it had our social in it. It had a lot of identifying information and so he knew they shouldn't have released it but that didn't stop the campaign from disseminating that information. And then if you kind of track into it more to see, well, was this just a mistake or was this nefarious conduct, you know, you find out, first of all, the timeline is ultra suspicious. >> Yeah. >> Again, you go into all of their procedures. They should have had a signature from me. They didn't. They should have had my social security number. The person at the archives went into a VA website that they had access to. This isn't something you or I could go on. This is government website, a special website. they had access to. They pulled my social security number from that and then used that to get access to my records. And then they should have I they should have notified the Navy, which they didn't do. So all of this was conduct that shows you that this was a weaponization of my records, my personal information that working in conjunction with the Trump administration and their archives, um, the Jack Chidarelli team was able to get access to. and then despite like I this stuff was stamped in different places with like PII and stuff like that knowing it shouldn't be disseminated did so anyway to sort of weaponize this and I am just you know here in New Jersey we are known for like tough knockdown >> oh yeah >> out fights I have them all the time I I will go toeto toe with anybody because I'm you know I am going to serve the people of New Jersey, no matter what it takes. Gosh darn it. But nevertheless, this lack of honor, this this just complete disregard for somebody's personal identifying information. My parents' information was in there. They're in their 80s and now I'm try I'm worried about protecting their credit and and you know how I can do that and not to mention my own. Um it is really it is really a a a new low I think. Um and I think the people of New Jersey of course should be really concerned about somebody running to be governor who has no you know if he's going to do this to me. Imagine how he's going to treat the information of the people of New Jersey. And that's what sh I mean the details of the story and I've read the articles are so much worse, you know, and the way they're trying to spin it, the archives and your opponent are trying to spin it as, oh no, it was just a clerk who who sent the wrong file and and you're it's clear as you go through this. That's far that's so far from the truth. This was an act by a person with a personal agenda who sent it to your opponent who then like you said was shocking is a veteran got this and did know better. I did no better and yet still gave it to the opponent and who then gave it to reporters. So step by step you see Jack Shidarelli and his machine and this is machine politics. We're talking New Jersey are will do anything to win and and and they sat on this and you and another point is that was June. It's October to October 1st next week. I mean it's I guess that's just October surprise of some kind as they combed through it to find negative. I mean it does say a lot about your opponent and his morals and his ethics and he wants to lead. I mean it it does this surprise you at all in a certain sense? >> You know it it doesn't. I mean sadly it should. This should be so beyond the pale. And yet when we see attack after attack after attack from Trump and MAGA Republicans on people. I remember several years ago listening to a recording that somebody from the Jim Johnson crew uh somebody pretty much threatening Don Bacon's wife because he wasn't voting for Jim Johnson as speaker and how he was going to put this out online and she was going to be, you know, everybody was going to hate them and they were going to come after them and he kept saying all these key words in he'd say like in a nonviolent manner like obviously very well aware of just how to skirt the law while insinuating all the threats possible and I think knowing that we have people who've tried to kidnap the governor of Michigan I mean we know who these people are and how threatening they can be so to see that kind of um attack that kind of utilization of the federal government against individuals was in some ways Not surprising. It was incredibly disappointing though to see it um sort of transplanted here in New Jersey. But my opponent keeps saying he's going to do that. You know, he said he can't think of anything he disagrees with Trump on. He said it's his job to support the president. He says stuff like he's never going to take him to court. And um so again and again, we see that this is how he intends to do this. He wants to remake our court like Trump did. That kind of stuff. And so, you know, I guess he keeps telling us who he is, >> you know. >> Right. Right. You know, and and another thread to pull on this, I think, and we touched a little bit, but I do want to go back to it, is I'm a veteran. And, you know, I've I was in the Army 22 years, four years at West Point. Uh, I graduated in the top twothirds of my class. Uh, and my It's funny when when this came out, my fiance said to me, he goes, \"Wow, are you worried about them releasing your academic records?\" Like, \"Hey, I was I was number 600 on 900. Thank you very much. You know, she goes, \"You think they'll use it against you? That I'm stupid? >> My body is squeeze fat.\" >> Yeah. I mean, I think I think everybody >> the best people graduate. >> Well, the thing, you know, the joke is that because I did the study, my eyes didn't go bad then and I was able to fly. All the smart people, their eyes went back. But but again, as a veteran, you know, more more serious side of this is it is shocking that there are people in our government that have so little they went into the VA. I mean, what you just said was even more shocking that my question is wrong because you they went into the VA database to get your personal identifying information to use to authorize release records that never should have released at all to a political opponent. I mean, this is a lot. This is a lot for the entire veterans community. If the V the VA's got 9 million of our records, right? But I mean that the larger issue here for us as veterans, you and I and our community that we're a part of is really shocking is I mean they could they will how far will they go to destroy someone who was opponent if they'll do this. >> Well, that's just it. And this is part of why I'm speaking out so much on this issue because I'm a sitting member of Congress, >> right? and >> they can >> and and I ability to fight back to to have this platform to talk about it and to push back against it and to to get agencies um that I can have help get my credit secured and stuff like that. You know, imagine the veteran who writes an op-ed against Jack Chidarelli >> against Donald Trump and what are they going to do to that person? Imagine, you know, I have been out of the military for quite some time. A lot of that information was not as recent as it would have been if id just gotten out say two years ago or less. >> Right? >> So imagine if all that was there. Imagine if there was stuff about my children. I mean my parents were in there but you know there's nothing that I think that the toughest part right now about running. There's a lot of sleepless nights. There's a lot of punches you take in the face. There's a lot of really nefarious conduct um by you know MAGA Republicans. There's all this is kind of what you sign up for, but what you don't sign up for is putting your family in danger in any way. And so all of this is to say that if this can happen to me, imagine how they could just quash somebody that doesn't have the resources or access that I do. >> Right? And this, you know, and this is what they want you to think. They want, you know, Trump and people like Jack Chidarelli want to shut you down and shut down your voice and make sure you don't speak up and you keep your head down. And if you do, oh, look what we can do. >> And this is what we're fighting. And and I just like you, I know the veterans community very, very well. And I think this will have the opposite effect. >> Yeah. I think I think we have to carry that message to our fellow veterans like this. You are just they will they will not respect your service. They will not respect your privacy and and we all know from service it's all out there. There's nothing you can't hide anything in the military right they go through you know it's like Jesus I mean how far is it to start releasing our DD8 you know our background what DD86 whatever now your your secret you know that that's every dirty suit you've ever had is in there. I mean why not I mean it's that easy. everything you've it's everything everyone you love. Right. Right. So my um I was going through a background check for security clearances at the US attorney's office when there was that data breach. And I remember my husband coming to me and going, \"Oh man, that is going to be you're you better be really careful because you've got to secure all your credit and stuff like that.\" I go, \"Oh honey, we have to be really careful.\" Like when they do a security background, you know, when they're doing your background check, they're it's not you in a, you know, in a bubble, it's like all the people, you know, right? >> You ever know exactly >> right, I mean, nothing is safe here. And that's why this, you know, this is so important. This fight is so important. I think the governor's race is so important. This is one of only two races in the entire nation. and Trump knows that if I win like I think New Jersey is capable of showing up for a kind of victory here, then that is a huge shot across the bow um about, you know, for his power because that will show all of the people running for Congress, uh all the the people up for governor next year that his policies aren't popular, that that something has to shift. And so I think, you know, this is so critically important to sort of hopefully finally maybe drive a wedge in some of the um you know in the Republican party so it's just not monolithically taking the entire country off a cliff. >> Yeah. And people wake up that this is all of us run this way. You know, it's the old saying, you know, you're who's to say you're not gonna be next? just they if there's writing I mean you go back to what you said earlier they're threatening Don Bacon for those who aren't paying attention Don Bacon's a Republican you know I mean I mean so >> Right so if you think you're safe because you're Republican today >> wrong right >> right right and and you know that's why when this happened a bipartisan group of people came out against it conservative talk radio here has come out against this type of behavior um this This is just this is beyond the pale. It really really is. >> Yeah. It's fascinating to me. They they talked about your graduation, but they didn't I I got I dug into your past, too, and I found this scandalous document right here. And this is for those who aren't familiar with it. This is from the Naval Academy superintendent. That's the three star that runs the joint. It's the Naval Academy. We still respect them. And that is the Navy Achievement Medal, which is a medal. And you got the Navy Chief Medal as a midshipman which for those understand I think you were third class which makes you what your second year if I'm correct at the Navy Academy. I don't speak Navy. >> All those strikes my year sophomore year I was a youngster. >> A youngster they call him. So tell us about this shocking document from your time at the Naval Academy and why you had it. >> Well um that's nice you put that up. Uh I no longer have the pilot eyes I once had. So um >> I will bring it up. It's your nam. It's your It's your n for saving your classmates's life. That's So for those who can't read it, that is a Navy achievement she received as a midshipman for an emergency, a medical emergency while sailing offshore in bad weather when your classmate had a heart problem, right? Or she collapsed. Is that >> Yeah. So you make it sound a lot um classier than it was. Uh >> I just read the document. I'm just >> You know, it's Navy Carl. We we were not, you know, I wasn't on a sailboat, unfortunately. I was on a what was called a yard patrol craft. >> Okay. >> Small. It would look like a mini destroyer. It was a training craft for seammanship and navigation. And so >> no, we remember mocking the carry. >> Sure you did. And um so we were out at sea and we were off the coast of North Carolina and they had just had some hurricanes come through. the seas were incredibly rough and the winds were bad and so a lot of people these these ships are I I would say you know barely seaorthy I think they're mostly meant to be in the Chesapeake for training you know we taking them farfield and so we're off the coast of North Carolina and in kind of the Outer Banks area which are known you know to be quite rough ste >> and a hurricane had blown through so it was really really um tough so a lot of people were getting seasick And I don't get motion sick very often. So I was at that hel, you know, I was up on the bridge and a few people were. We kind of had a skeleton crew going because so many people were really, really sick. And um I remember I was sent down at one point to feed ice chips to um and I remember one of the comments I got to this day because it still kind of cracks me up. I went over to one person. I said, \"Um, you're supposed to eat some ice chips.\" And she looked at me and she goes, \"Who are you?\" Flores slim to die. Tempers were high. >> What did the I joined the army for a reason, Mikey? >> Great. Um, but we were I, you know, so we had the skeleton crew. So, um, one of my classmates had, you know, was trying to stand watch, but I don't think she'd eaten in quite some time. I think she'd been throwing up like most of the people on the the ship. So she came up and ended up passing out. >> Oh wow. >> And hit her head as she passed out and um had I think some I think some mild seizures but then uh stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. So uh myself and another machinim gave her rescue breathing and CPR for several hours because the helicopter could not we we weren't in stable enough waters and the winds were too bad to to get in there. I mean, I know you or I could have done it, but uh they couldn't like get in there to really be stable to safely evacuate her. So, it took them some time. And so, for a couple hours, we were able to provide CPR and rescue breathing. And um and then she she was okay. She she ended up in, you know, doing great. So, um, but it was a it was really, um, it was a real crisis. And, uh, I that was probably one of the first situations like that. Not the last you find yourself in in the military. There are just these intense moments. And um, and I tell people the military put you some real and some not. you know, the helicopter dunker, which we in the Navy had to do, is when you got strapped in and blindfolded and turned upside down and dropped in the water and had to swim out, which put me like I felt like I was in a crisis situation. I hated that thing. So, sometimes manufactured, sometimes real crises, but it happens so often that you do become, I don't want to say comfortable, but you know how to operate in a crisis. And I don't think you realize that. I don't know if you did. when I was young and the academy and stuff like that, I don't think I realized how that, you know, how that operated. >> Yeah. >> Until you're years later and you realize you you have a way of approaching a crisis. >> Yep. >> You know, and you just you just have been through so many >> Yep. >> that you just sort of get to it and uh and I kicks him >> on that very funny. I was I was in Colorado with my family of dropping our oldest uh my fiance's oldest off of college and we're coming down the mountain and there's a giant a guy a motorcycles got hit add head on and all the traffic stopped and nobody's doing anything and I'm like oh I throw the car park and I just get out and I start I started directing traffic I fast with the radio we you know we just got it all organized and people like who are you like ah it's a dude >> that's still fascinating >> you know and my and my fiance is like do you do that often like yeah I mean somebody had to you I'm absolutely shocked as I sit here because I was driving down the street in one of our towns and everyone was stopped. And so we pulled up behind a car and we're just waiting there. I'm like, what's going on? And so I, you know, get out and there's a motorcycle guy down. There is a woman in her driveway that seemed apparently had hit him and she seemed to be sort of just sitting there and other people were just sitting. The person that was had arrived on the scene first was just sitting there and I I just was puzzled but yeah >> exactly >> you have all those training too. So I got out of like it immediately comes back to you call 911 lend you know like that's your first thing >> ego are you okay you all the stuff I I just I can't believe you had >> so I'm like the suburbs of New Jersey not the mouse Colorado so yours uh yours seem to be much >> it's great the the volunteer firefighter with the radio she goes who are you like just some  it's like great well good  go make those cars move so we get the ambulance okay I Got it. You're in charge now. And I'm running I run past my family and my fiance's like, \"This  guy.\" So anyway, good talk. I know you got to go. You probably got none of your interviews lined up. I've taken so much your time. I We could talk all day. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I appreciate you standing out and I know it's painful because they're going to try and throw that they can at you and they'll dig things up. I didn't even I'm not going to touch the lies and the BS and the spend, but glad you're in the fight. We wish you the best of luck because you got your election just a month. Um, it's a key election and our friend Abigail Spammaker, who by the way, I think introduced us, which is the one here, I think we were at the DNC and Abigail's like, you know, Mike, you know, like I've never met. She goes, \"God damn it, you need to.\" So, it's like, \"You have too much in common. You should know each other.\" So, we uh I really appreciate your time. Tell your team. I said, \"Thank you very much.\" And, uh, good luck out there. We We're following you. Let's know if we can do anything to help. Yeah. >> Well, I really appreciate it. And if everyone could go to mikeysherald.com, sign up to chip in to volunteer to phone bank to canvas to text banking. We can use all the help we can get. We've got a real fight on our hands here. We do have just a little over a month left. So um I I think this is such a central race to really this nation and the future and uh we'd love your help. So thank you so much.",

    "transcript_text": "09/29/2025 - Sherrill - RachelMaddow Sure. Um, so what happened was the Trump administration illegally released my unredacted military personnel records to an ally of the Chitterelli campaign who then shopped it around to press uh even despite being in his own words shocked and disgusted when he saw that it contained things like my social security number, my parents addresses, my 80-year-old parents addresses. So, um, this was not unknown, that this was information that should not have been in the public. And if there was any question, when they shopped it to the press, the journalist who got it told them this should not be out here. In fact, he wrote a whole article about it um and warned them that this was not information. And yet, they continued to push this information out and have not um have not given it back, have not ceased using it. So, it really, you know, what they're putting out is just not true. And then furthermore, when we look at how this happened, when we worked with the journalist who was presented with this information and went back to the archivist to see how this happened, there's no mistake that was made here. This was intentional. And I'll tell you, um, if you speak to the professional archists that were there, uh, remember Trump fired them and now Marco Rubio is in charge of the archives, not a professional archist. um you'll hear that it takes months if not over a year to get access because they're so behind. And yet what happened here was there was a request for my data a day before my primary and um the gentleman from the the ally of the Chidarelli campaign was told no, you can't have this. You need certain you need to meet certain wickets to get it. Um, and then two days after the primary that I won, he found, and I quote, a real helpful person at the archives office to get that information to them. Now, here's what should have happened. The archives should have requested a signature of mine. They didn't have it. They should have had my social security number. The way they got that was that a technician in the archives went into the VA database, which they had access to as a federal agency. We would not have access to that, to get my social security number to then pull my files, which they then gave to this ally of the Chidarelli campaign. Then they should have told the Navy that they had done so. They never did that. And so there's really no doubt in my mind that this was fully intentional from the Trump administration to the Chidarelli campaign to attempt to do this. And they've continued now to go after my family, my husband's service, my kids in a completely inappropriate way. So I have to I just have to say to the New Jersey people, if he's doing this to me, a sitting member of Congress and a veteran, imagine what he'll do with your information. Do you feel like you're running against Jack Chidarelli, the the Republican candidate, but also running against the federal government? Uh, I mean, the the the federal government has this and the US military has this information. Uh, because we don't have a choice about whether or not they have it. We have to trust that they will safeguard it in a way that's both safe uh, responsible and legal. Uh, it seems to me like you're up against something that is more than your average political dirty trick. Yeah, this is pretty low. And that's why I I really just have to say thank you to the veterans from across this country, from Korea to Vietnam to the global war on terror, veterans from across this country who have reached out in solidarity with me because this is beyond the pale because as veterans, many of us have incredibly high security clearances. I myself had the highest security clearance in the military and the amount of information our nation has when they do that. They interview your friends and your neighbors and they go through your medical records and those of your family and friends. It just to think that you you have this that the government has this information and could use it against you. It is just completely completely unacceptable to veterans. And so I have to tell people out there, thank you so much for your support. And I'm just committing to people in New Jersey, to veterans across this country. I'm running for governor because I can take this. Jack Chidarelli can come after me. Donald Trump can come after me. But I am gonna be governor so you don't have to put up with this. So when Trump comes after New Jerseyians and their private data, their social security numbers, their driver's license. I was just talking to Governor Josh Shapiro earlier today. He has told Trump no. And I will tell Trump no when he comes after people in my state so they don't have to go through this.",

    "transcript_text": "10/01/2025 - Sherrill - ZachSangShow Hi guys. Nice to be here. You represent me. I Well, I did until you absconded to the West Coast. You know, I got to say I do live half and half between LA and my primary residence resides in Packenac, which is your district. I love it. I love it. You represent me. You represent my family. Nice. I drive around my my my town of Wayne. I drive around all of northern New Jersey. And what do I see? Mikey Cheryl signs everywhere. Oh, good. Good. We are trying to up our lawn sign game. Yeah, you are. This is wild. The whole thing is very very fascinating to me for a bunch of different reasons. One, we're in a very unique time, but two, you're an incredibly unique candidate. I mean, your career genuinely sounds like it was written for a movie. You were a part of the Naval Academy. You're a helicopter pilot. You did you're a Russian policy officer. Uh, you're a prosecutor or were you're a mom of four. Now you're a member of Congress. I mean, is there a wild chapter that genuinely sticks out in your brain from life, or is it all just kind of an acculation of to where we're at today? Oh, wow. That's a really good question. So, kind of both. Um, you know, I wanted a I guess I when I was little, I wanted a big life. It's funny you say it sounds like a movie. I did watch a lot of the Cold War movies and um that sounded exciting. My grandfather was a bomber pilot in World War II and I grew up on those stories and I wanted to fly and I wanted to serve my country and so there were moments, you know, going to the Naval Academy. You you from a very early age have those kind of big moments. Um so I when I was a um when I was a youngster it's called. So you're a pleb um for your first year. That's really a bad year. That's when you're like, yeah, everybody's kind of, I think what they would call it in other colleges is hazing. The Navy calls it training, but you're getting yelled at. You're under all this pressure all the time. You're always late to something. You're always in trouble. And um then you get you graduate from your plea beer and you become a youngster. And so I was going on youngster crews and we were going on these yard patrol craft, which are supposed to be, you know, training for seammanship and navigation. But um we were taking a fleet of them, about five or six I think down the coast to the islands and on our way back we hit some hurricanes. And so the seas were really rough. And these aren't big vessels, these are small yard patrol craft. So we're hitting these seas and they're really, you know, they're the waves are huge and everyone's getting really seasick. And I didn't get motion sick. So I'm going around and I am I remember feeding ice chips to people. In fact, one of my one of my friends who was lovely but was not feeling very well, I came to her and I'm like, \"You have to eat these ice chips.\" And she goes, \"Who are you? Florence  Nightingale.\" I was just like, \"Okay, just eat the ice chips, maybe.\" Um, so we're like we're, you know, out at sea and and like I said, everyone's getting really sick and um, so one person on the bridge passes out and hits her head and stops breathing and her heart stops beating. And so we are trying to radio for the medevac, but the seas are too rough. They can't they can't get her off. The helicopter's like trying that the wind, the seas, etc. for I think over two hours and I had been a lifeguard and then we take we trained on CPR and rescue breathing over plea plebe and so I um performed CPR and rescue breathing on her several times as her heart was stopping and as we're trying to get medevac people are out on they're like hooked to the line you know because the seas are so rough so they wouldn't go overboard and we're we're um trying to get her evacuated and she eventually was and it was at that time that you you're like oh cuz you you know during ple summer you're sort of thinking now why is this necessary you know why are we doing this again why are you yelling at me um but it sort of I remember at that you know at that time thinking oh you really you really have to know how to execute things under a great deal of stress and pressure you really are going to be put in these situations where you can't freeze in a crisis, you have to make decisions and you have to be fairly clear-headed in making those decisions to get to good um to get to good decisions. So I think like of a moment like that, but then I also to your question of has it all led up to this? I also remember you know I was in the Navy and then I went to law school because I was upset about torture and rendition and Guantanamo. So, I went to law school and then I went to a law firm which felt like a complete break. you know, I'm in the Navy and then suddenly I'm at a law firm in Manhattan and I felt like gosh, I I did something with my life for like 10 years and now I'm at square one and then I went to the prosecutor's office and then going into Congress did sort of feel like oh being in the Navy, being a prosecutor, you know, being a mom, everything I've done in my life actually because the the range of things you handle in Congress is so broad that every sing Yeah. suddenly felt like it was all kind of coming together in that moment in a in a nice way. No, because it is true, right? Like you need to have the empathy and heart and the mindset of a mother, but you also have to have the decision-making of a Navy Seal, but you also have to have the foreign knowledge, experience of a Russian policy officer. And then you also have to understand and know the law like a prosecutor. Everything is tested on every on a daily basis. everything you are tested. And I think, you know, I love how you set that up because I think it's so important in these times, people want to know you have integrity and they want to know you're tough. Nobody's like, you know, people aren't okay with you just sort of like, oh, you know, I'm just going to hang out here in Congress. And people want to see results. Like their their lives are feeling very risky. They're feeling very dependent. It's a life or death situation. It It is in in so many cases. And they also want to know though that you care, that you're not going to go in there and do like total like jerky asshole things like the president, but that you're actually going to come at it like I'm doing this because I'm focused on you. And I think being a mom gives people that sense, oh, she's not just here to make a buck or she's not just here to serve herself. She's here because the long play is making sure her kids are okay. … I think if you do it in a way where you're thinking it's better for my kids and your kids, if they have opportunities, if they have a good education system, if they have a fair playing field, because I don't know, like, you know, you look at families across the board and some people do great and some people don't. want everybody to have this opportunity. Where it gets just selfish is if you're just looking at the world and you're saying, I want my kids to do okay and I don't give a you know what about your kids and I just want to make sure that I get as much power as I can and I have as much generational wealth and you know what I'm going to climb the ladder of success. Then I'm pulling it up behind me because I just want to ensure that my family's okay. And and I say that because I a guy just said to me the other day, you know, in this economy, if your last name's not Trump, you're not getting anything. And I thought, wow, you know, that seems right. That seems like where this is headed. Um, no. I mean, I I see them all the time. They say stuff like, \"Oh, I would never cut Medicaid for people.\" And then when Trump says jump, they say, \"How high?\" Totally. In fact, it got so ridiculous when some of these bills were being passed and I I've got to go back and look up who it was. But one member of Congress, a reporter asked him, \"Are you going to vote for the what are you going to do about this bill?\" And he said, \"I'm probably going to complain about it a lot and then just vote for it.\" I can't imagine those words ever leaving my mouth. That's crazy. By the way, you find that time and time again, right? I mean, Lisa Marowski. I mean, there's a bunch there's a bunch of examples just off the top of my head connect to this big beautiful disaster. Yeah. That Well, and I'm running against one of them, right? Like, this is what drives me crazy. So, I'm running for governor and I'm running against this guy, Jack Chidarelli, who literally said he can think of no way in which he disagrees with Donald Trump. And I'm always like, man, I have a list I would like to share with him about all the ways in which this is going south. And then he said that um it's his job to support the president. And I'm just sitting here going, you're running to be governor of New Jersey. And I have taken on anyone who gets in the way of serving New Jersey. I mean, I've taken on really powerful members of my own party because it's a my job is not to serve the Democratic party. I mean, I may be a Democrat, but I'm a New Jerseyian first, right? So that's not my job. my job is to serve the people of New Jersey. And then here's a guy who thinks his job is to be sort of a bootlicker for Trump. Like come on. And then he said that everybody should feel little pain in supporting Trump's tariffs. Why? Why? What is the plan? Nobody even knows the plan with these tariffs. They're just raising costs on everybody. Why? What is the end goal? What is the agenda? Why should we all feel this pain? It's ridiculous. And yet in this tortured, convoluted MAGA world, you know, you've got to come up with some weird rationale for destroying the country at the behest of Donald Trump. Why does New Jersey need you as our governor and not in Congress? Oh, did you hear my last answer? No, I'm teasing. No, I'm teasing. So we've lost a lot of power and probably um there's the the two areas that are so bad is you have an executive that is willing to just do whatever the heck he wants. I almost felt like his first the first Trump administration was like a test run and he kind of noted all of those areas where people stood up against him like the US military which he immediately then came into office again fired all the admirals and generals. Um, and so you see all of this going on and then we've the courts, they've really consolidated power in the courts. And this, you know, I went to law school. I'm um I remember, you know, 19, I want to say 95ish, uh, is when the Federalist Society was founded. So for years they've been working on pathways for people to get into the courts and take over the Supreme Court. So now we're here. And so whereas we might lose the presidency, we've had the courts to backs stop rights and freedoms. We don't have that. So now it's states rights. Now it's in the states. It's why I'm running for governor because this is where the battle is right now is at the state in the states. It's really scary. No, it's very scary. Um because it's it's something that um I look at the future and it just looks so bleak if we can't turn this around. I you know I go I I talk to thousands of New Jerseyians a month, right? Sometimes a week, sometimes a day. um just going around speaking to so many different people and I can be in a room with hundreds of people in it and I I say to them, I bet every single person in this room has a story about why this country was so instrumental to providing them and their family opportunity in a way that they couldn't have found anywhere else in the world. And nobody's ever challenged me. Nobody's ever said no. And even when I'm speaking to members of the black community, it's always with the caveat, look, or provided the opportunity to continue to grow power because of our constitution. And now nobody feels that way. You know, people feel like, look, if your last name's not Trump or if you're not already rich, you're not getting there. And I mean, that's exactly the type of economy is, look, we're going to take this upper class group of people, we're going to cement them, and then nobody else is going to have any opportunity. And for so many of us, like my dad grew up poor in West Virginia, my mom grew up in a union family, and they'd lost everything in the Great Depression. I had more opportunity created for me as they lifted combat exclusions um for women. So all of this has been a growth and opportunity and now I keep seeing all these doors shutting. Oh totally. For people and it's strategically done. I would have said that was before this administration. I think now it's going to also be dictated by your ethnicity, by your gender, by your religion. I mean, so, okay, how does you have a mission in New Jersey to streamline the educational system? Correct. Yeah, that's one of the things that you want to do. Does the streamlining help create a more just society, a more equal opportunity? Well, to your point about zip code, that is really true in education in our state. So you've probably heard that New Jersey has the best public education system in the nation in Wayne, in Princeton, in Monontlair, but what about Patterson? What about Newark? What about Elizabeth? Right? And we just haven't been delivering everyone that education. And it's, you know, it's twofold for me. It's to me, you know, it's kind of a moral obligation. I think I think it's moral obligation of society to provide opportunity to people. That's a democracy. That's what I believe deeply in. that's, you know, what I'm committed to. But if you don't agree with me, that's fine because I also think, and I do believe this, too, that it's an economic imperative for New Jersey. We run the most high-end workforce in the We have the most high-end workforce in the nation. We have more scientists and engineers per square mile uh than anywhere else in the nation. We've had companies that have moved out of New Jersey only to move back because they couldn't find that workforce. And so we are we are kind of harming our economy if we don't provide a great education to every student in New Jersey. We're we're kind of holding ourselves back if we don't do that. And so it's both, I think, a moral imperative, but I also think it's good. It makes good economic sense. And so that's why I'm so focused on education in our state. And I I think one of the areas that's um I I think there's two things. One area that's a real inflection point according to educators is third grade. If you don't read at grade level at third grade, that's going to start to impact your education for for the rest of your educational career because you're not going to be able to read your science homework or your history homework or your math homework. So, it's not just reading and English, right? It starts to impact all the other areas. So, that's a really important point of making sure that kids have that and and we can really push in there with highintensity tutoring, etc. And we have too many places where kids are not reading at grade level. By the way, we've known that since I was in third grade. And I had a teacher who would take time out of her day to do because I couldn't read until I was 10 or 11 years old. And she took time out of her day to figure it out because there wasn't any sort of programs that were made available. So, it's so true. And I don't know what your experience was, but I have four kids. And I I tell this story. two of them went to this child- centered nursery school and I to this day I believe it was probably really developmentally appropriate but they were in no way prepared for kindergarten and I taught them to read and it was really hard and and I wasn't necessarily very good at it right but I was just it was constantly like trying to get them back on track and they struggled for many years it wasn't just kindergarten it was for many years trying to get their reading um up to speed and Um, then I had two kids that went to all daycare that was just very old school and traditional. They did all their letters and their and by and that set them up so much better to have like to read by third grade at a really good and it set them up for kind of the rest of their school career and really being kind of on top of it and not falling behind as much. And so I think preschool like universal prek is great and and some of the programs the governor's running to do that. But then I also think highintensity tutoring meaning um the same person three times a week at least half an hour connected to the school. So it's not just a oneoff random person. Maybe they're good, maybe they're bad, but somebody who knows what you're doing in class and can work with your teacher. That's really important. Um, and I think the other critical issue is making sure we're addressing the mental health crisis that's going on in our schools because if kids are going to be okay in school, they have to arrive to school ready to learn. There's a, you know, I was speaking to one pediatrician who was saying almost every child I know is in therapy right now. Um, we have an outbreak in anxiety. So much of this is related to kids online activity. Totally. And it's something that's been, you know, we tried to get kids line kids online safety act passed. Over 90 people, 90 senators voted for it, which is shocking. That happens to nothing. It immediately was killed in the house. Um why? Let's big tech paid Scalis a bunch of money and he wouldn't put it on the floor. Thank you for being that blunt and honest with the answer. I wish there was a better answer. I I I wish that wasn't that easy. But people should know that Steve Scaliz got money and in return kids are going to kill themselves and deal with mental health crisis and not have the the tools needed to manage these mental health crisis. And what's going to happen is kids are going to die. But it's okay. He got a new beach house. And we know they have because we've seen it right in the testimony before Congress of parents who showed exactly what their kid was looking at before they died by suicide. We know that the controls that were in place before Trump on Twitter and Meta are have all been removed. And so the bullying and attacks on especially LGBT youth we're seeing are horrible. And we also know that more and more kids are seeking therapy online. They're using chat GPT as therapy. So the whole thing is an environment where we are not doing enough as adults to keep kids safe to create a good environment. And all of this is also taking place when our kids just aren't engaging socially in the way that we would hope they would. And by kids, I mean even like 20s into the into the 20 year olds. I I was just talking to a bookstore owner and she said, \"Oh, it's really good.\" And she said this just so casually that it was almost chilling to me cuz I had seen this and I felt this way. But to have it reinforced was just sad. But she said, \"Oh, the good news is, you know, it's really good news because actually young adults are reading again, like hardcover books, which you know, we're both like, huh, who knew?\" You know, because everything's online. She goes, \"And it's really important because, you know, young adults can't socialize with each other. So having these book clubs and structured engagement is really important which I thought was great to have the structured engagement really scary that a lot of the impact that we're seeing in young people is carrying on into young adults and we don't know you know presumably beyond what by the way right now New Jersey requires public schools to teach about the contributions of the LGBTQIA plus communities and the individuals a part of them is that it is a policy that's fairly recent and quite unique. Is that something that is on the chopping block if Jack was to get into office? So, we have a group, I think they're nationwide, they're certainly in New Jersey, called Moms for Liberty, and they have been sort of on the spearhead of targeting LGBT youth, LGBTQ youth. So, um, having huge crusades about bathrooms in schools, for example, and so they've been on the forefront of this and they they're somebody that I think even just two weeks ago, Jack had a big meeting with them. And the reason I bring this up is because raising kids is really scary. It it just is. You're you're constantly worried. Even, you know, your most welladjusted kid, you're still worried about constantly. And and there's this old saying that I think is so true. It's um you're only as happy as your most unhappy child. You know, as a parent that just resonates because you're there's constantly, you know, something you're worried about. And these times have been particularly tough. Co was awful. It was just awful for families in New Jersey in so many different ways. And even some of the things everybody was just kind of, you know, you're just trying to get through and then you talk to your kids about it maybe even afterwards and they're still processing and they mention how bad it was and you think, \"Oh my god, as a parent, I don't know if I realized how much they were struggling.\" And and so what you want is to make sure that in the places you can, places like school where your kid spends time with their peers, that they have a welcoming environment. And I would say the majority of people who've gone K through 12 education have had that year or those couple years that were just awful. You know, they were just for whatever reason, some of it maybe self-created, some of it not. For me it was seventh grade and I you know my daughter was saying well why why was it I go I just you know for so many reasons and I just was miserable and I just remember you know going to my locker at breaks between classes and just kind of twirling it because I had no one to talk to or anything and I didn't want to go sit in class by myself and not talk to anyone there. So I would just kind of take forever opening my locker and then open it and then put some books in the back. you know, and do it really slowly so I seemed like I was doing something and it wasn't apparent that I was just like a total loser. And uh so, you know, I seemed like on a mission. So, um I was just talking about it with her and I was thinking about, you know, all these kids and and as a parent, you just really want to know it doesn't get so bad that kids decide to do something that's harmful to themselves or that they eventually, you know, I do think going through these tough times makes more empathetic people. And and sometimes, you know, even if you could as a parent, you probably wouldn't want to protect your child from every tough thing because what kind of adult would that make, right? But it's hard nevertheless. And you want to at least defay them the worst. You don't want them bullied. You don't want um them targeted. You don't want them going to the internet for information. And so to have moms, moms for liberty, targeting kids to me is a sign of a problem in society. If that's how you gain power, if that's how you gain attention, that you're targeting vulnerable kids. And I will tell you that is something that I think the majority of people in New Jersey agree with. I've been to some very red areas where people agree with that statement that it's up to me as a parent, how I want to raise my kid. And if our kids are going to a trusted adult to talk about sensitive issues, that should stay there. And if we tell them they can't do that, by the way, parents, they're not coming to you. No, they're going to retreat and talk. They're going to go online. They're going to go and chat GPT. And is that where you want them getting? Would you rather that than their teacher? And I can make the case that conservatives rather have kids going to chatbt to seek out advice as there's lines of money if you connect all the dots. So yeah, like the answer is yes. Like big Yes. Yes. They want them flocking to big tech. Um they do. Taylor ham or pork pork roll. What do you call it? Come on. You're from Wayne. I call it Taylor. Taylor ham. Yeah. Thank you. Who eats pork roll? Not me. I think that's gross. I don't even know what it is. I've had this fight multiple times. Nobody wants pork roll. How are we going to fix New Jersey Transit? What are we going to do? So, we have a lot of work to do. We need a dedicated source of funding. And transportation systems across the country and across the world do not run on fairs and we keep upping fairs for worse service. Wait, explain that to me. They don't run on fairs. No, fairs. It would be They would never make money. they would never make m they wouldn't provide enough money to run the system and to keep it up to date and upgraded. So it provides a good input to it. But you have transit oriented development. You have parking lots where you make money. You have advertising where you make money. Um, and in all these ways, leasing property around the stations, especially, you know, internationally, that's generally the way you do it is you don't just run the train, you own the property around the stations and that gives you um money that you put back into the system because, let's face it, it's a huge economic boon if your town has a train station. That's a big deal that I mean you look at um you look at like part of my district Montlair Chadam Madison Morristown I mean these are all towns developed along the train line and the train stops but that was done in the 1800s. Totally. So it's time to also remap what we're doing for public transportation, how we're getting people across the state and how we're getting people off the roads. Um, so both getting the dedicated source and then remapping it and then making, let's face it, let I mean, making the port authority actually pay something for New Jersey, not just New York. They've got to update some of these path systems and stuff. They're they're there's a bunch of fires that are going on right now that they've got to address. By the way, we are a busy state, right? Most of the state operates on buses. Is your ideal vision to move from bus to rail? There are areas I'd love to see a light rail and rail. I'm I keep encouraging new technology because we are the most densely populated state trying to figure out how we're going to um run highspeed rail systems through a state when you're you know when you have that in New York as well. I'd love to see some of the tunneling technology or other new technology that we could really totally um you know come up affordably with a plan to do that but in the meantime highspeed bus transit. So mapping out where you want to put the lines, but in the meantime getting the busi systems in place so that people already start using the public transportation. I do believe doing that is the way that we are going to revive Atlantic City. I agree. I have to tell you I I I I'm I'm almost, you know, I don't want to overpromise anything because I think people have seen the gem that Atlantic City is for many years and there have been several failed attempts to revitalize it, but that is the most known city in the entire state of New Jersey. Totally. Atlantic City and all it we just need access people from all of the great I say this all the time. What do I say? How great is New Jersey's proximity to the greatest to the biggest cities on earth from DC to Philly to New York City. There's so much access. Funnel it right into the Jersey Shore. There's always stuff going on. And I think Atlantic City would be like a fantastic final four destination, but if you're going to do something like that, you need quick. They're just not close enough to an international airport. There's requirements for those types of events. So, you're exactly right. We We need better transportation. We need to fix the fact that it's a food desert. I think there's a lot of food deserts that exist in New Jersey that need fixing. What is a food desert? Do you want to explain it? But it's an area that has no access to fresh produce and there's tons. And that's why, you know, it's funny you mentioned that because one of the things that I've been focused on is how do we drive grocery store costs down. Thank you. And competition in the market. And so having grants for kind of mom and pop grocery stores because starting a grocery store is really expensive. If you're doing a Whole Foods, if you're even doing mom and pop, you have to buy the freezers and the cash register. So the startup costs, make it really difficult. But if we could defay those, we can both get competition into the market to drive down prices, but address some of the food deserts. Your competitor in this race, Jack, I don't want to say his last name because I really don't know how to say it. He was looking at taking different tax systems from different states. I heard that there was talk of maybe a Tennessee tax system could be upwards of 10% on a tax on everything. Shopping, so food, wants to do a tax. He wants to consider doing a tax on everything. But if you call him on it, because this could raise the tax on groceries by 10%. So at a time when I've been desperately trying to lower cost, this would raise cost by 10% on groceries. But every time you call him on anything, Jack's taken like three sides on every issue here. So he won't come out and say he's not going to do it because he's thinking of doing it. But then when you say, \"Oh, you're doing this.\" No, I was talking about Tennessee. You're lying. I'm like, come on. Can you please explain to me why New Jersey would need a tax system like that to achieve whatever his vision is? And compared to that, like, do you need to change the tax system in New Jersey to streamline education, to better New Jersey transit? And I want to talk about health a little bit, too. we need to we need better we need better programming for where our tax dollars are going and that so something that is um that makes New Jersey incredibly high a high-cost place to live is some of um for example all the the many different school systems we run so we have 564 municipalities that's more than California yeah it's crazy and we have more school systems than we do municipalities But there's shared services there. Everything there are shared services that we need to dot and you're talking we have some of the oldest school buildings in the nation. Many of them need updating. So we shouldn't be putting all our money into these administrative costs or or the building costs of the administration. We should be putting them into students. We should be putting them into teachers into the buildings and not you know all of these different sometimes they're they're not even running K through2 programs and they have this full administrative staff. So, we really do need to be addressing that driving cost down there. I think there, you know, a lot of people say, \"Well, Mikey, everybody says that.\" And I think there was a time when people would almost give it a pass because they could still afford a house. They could still afford their energy bills. They could still put food on the table. They could still maybe take a week down the shore. Not anymore. Not anymore. Property taxes are through the roof. And you're not getting housing prices are through the roof and energy prices are through the roof. and grocery store prices are through the roof. So, it's come to the breaking point where we really, you know, if we don't address this, we are just not going to be the same state we are now. We're not going to have intergenerational families. Seniors aren't going to be able to stay. New families aren't going to be able to stay. So, this is pretty dire at this point. It's really smart. The sharing of municipality resources, the economy of scale, streamlining everything. What about ADUs? Granny Flats that may be needed in New Jersey for the aging population. it. Well, if for the aging population, for the young people, um you have um I can't tell you right now and and certainly we want to address housing costs and part of that is things like ADUs. I can't tell you how many young people are still living at home because they can't afford to buy a house. And you know what? Their parents want a tough shed from the shop in Clifton and they're going to put a bathroom in it if the state allows and put them in the backyard and voila and voila. and they don't have to look at their mess. But then eventually it switches place, right? The roles reverse, right? And you the kid grows up and takes over the larger house. And then eventually you have an aging population that you have to take care of Medicare costs and the cost of like putting your a parent into a home when it's time through the roof. Where we might be under real pressure because of these Medicaid cuts because remember Medicaid funds a lot of nursing home care. And so these huge Medicaid cuts that Trump has introduced and that they've passed, the Republicans have passed are really imperiling some of how you care for seniors across the state. So that so that becomes even more of a necessity, but you're exactly right. New Jersey at one time, and it might still be was the state known for the most intergenerational family members. And so, right, so you you want to be able to have your kids. I mean, I honestly want all my I told my kids I want them all to live like right next door to me. And my of course my youngest daughter who's total contrarian goes I'm gonna move to China. It's like why I have several years to change your mind. I don't want to make you jealous but uh I do own a house down the street from my mom which is right across the lake from Packenack from my dad and my stepmom. Oh and this is like my dream right now. You got I got to say I am very proudly New Jersey and I grew up between Wayne and Monontlair. So I grew up uh in the apartment complex right across from the library. Y um obviously you know it um but you my mom was a social worker in Patterson for 37 years. My stepmom was a high school teacher up at County Tech for 15 years. And my dad has been doing mortgages for most of those multi-generational family houses that you just referenced, right? New Jersey in many many places from Carney all the way to New York and Patterson there are these larger homes that will literally house I mean in some cases it could be four generations of family members and they come together and they buy this property and it becomes something that's collectively theirs. It's a very special thing. Generational wealth. Totally. Which we want to see. And And yeah. No, it it really I think all these ideas of getting people into home ownership and it's it's really important and it's really we're kind of at the breaking point right now for people being able to do that. New the average home price is half a million dollars. So, by the way, for for for a a onebedroom, twobedroom, one bath, you know, very little. Yeah. When you think about the next 10 years, what's something that you love to see young people help do to shape this country in a better way or better direction? I Wow. I It's so interesting because I feel like that's my responsibility. I feel like I shouldn't be putting it on young people. We've made this mess and I feel like we got to get us out of this mess. But nevertheless, I would love for young people to double down on what it means to um live in a community and a democracy. And I say it like that because right now it feels like what Trump is doing is creating this every man for himself, every woman for herself mentality. And you're it's like everything's a zero- sum game and you're fighting everybody else to get ahead. I I think that young people are much more community-minded and much more willing to embrace these ideas of how do we lift up the entire community? How do we provide education to everyone? How do we provide better opportunity? And the reason that's so necessary is young people are the ones that are going to face this AI revolution, the tech revolution. And so it's going to be a seismic change and it's going to be something that older people don't understand as well. And so I think this is where young people really come on board to say, okay, this is how we're going to move into this new space and we're going to make sure that it's not like this horrible 1920s robber baron situation, but rather how we create opportunity for everyone and everyone has a place in it. I can make the case that that is exactly what this country was founded on. Going back to the very beginning, out of many there is one. No, I I have to say that that this idea of democracy that I like the most is this idea that you create a society as if you're not going to know who you are going to be born as. So, you don't know if you're going to be a man or a woman or black or white or rich or poor or live in the north or the south or the Midwest, etc. You are just sort of going to be a baby in someone's household. And so you better create the best opportunity society that you can so that no matter how you're born, you're gonna have a shot. Like I love that vision and ideal. I'm excited for New Jersey to be a place that embodies and shares with the rest of the nation a blueprint of what can actually happen if you follow those morals and ideals and you have real integrity and you do lift everybody up and yeah, that excites me. Me too. and I am very excited to vote for you in November. Well, thank you. I don't know if you came here thinking I was actually a constituent or not, but I am because, you know, I thought you were at one time. I thought you had totally, you know, my mom is sick. So, I just officially moved back part time. So, I did have I did in the last couple months have to change my address and change everything and Yeah. And now you're back. I'm very sorry to hear about your bomb, but I'm glad we're sucking you back in in New Jersey. There's a there there's a silver lining to the whole thing. Amazing bagels, amazing pizza. Oh my god, you sound my daughter. That's what you want. So dramatic. She So she was up in Rhode Island and her friend was in Boston and she's telling me, \"Mom, do you know what happened the other day?\" And I said, \"What?\" She goes, \"Well, my friend went uh she heard there was a bagel place opening and there's no bagels here.\" And so she got up early and mom, she never gets up early. And she got up early to go to the bagel place and waited in line. And the bagels were this thick. She didn't even get one. She just left. And like this is like like she's telling me the story with the maximum drama you can tell it with, which is, you know, part for the course in New Jersey. But nevertheless, I am cracking up. I'm like, well, oh honey, thank God you're back here in the promised land of New Jersey. Yeah. Good. You We get her bagels every morning when she's home. It's like a a demand. Very cool to have you here. Really. Well, it's very cool to be here. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. Are you kidding? I thank you for taking the time and energy and thank you're running a great campaign. You really are. So, keep up the good work and keep up the good fight because New Jersey needs you. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate it and hope to see you soon. Really, thank you, Congresswoman, future governor of New Jersey, Mikey Cheryl. Everybody, thank you. Thanks again.",

    "transcript_text": "10/02/2025 - Ciattarelli - Cranford Thank you for all your efforts in the legislature. What we need to stop doing across the state of New Jersey, and I think an overwhelming number of Jerseyians agree, is stop taking garden out of the Garden State. That's exactly what's happening with these statemandated housing quotas. And if you want the perfect and most compelling example of all that's wrong with the current statemandated housing policies, it's right here on the land upon which we stand. to use eminent domain to condemn a 175-year-old family farm in order to accommodate the need to build highdensity housing in a community where there is no infrastructure, where there is no mass transit, where there are no jobs per se, only putting more idling cars on the road is wrong in every way and it needs to end. Overdevelopment of our suburban communities is one of the top four issues in this year's race for governor. And my opponent has failed to say what her plan is. My plan is we're going to stop the statemandated affordable highdensity housing units we're seeing all across our suburban communities. I really do believe we need to take an approach that's more consistent with smart growth strategies. And having lived in the last two communities I've lived in over the last 28 years, I've seen this up close and personal. For 25 years, I lived in Hillsboro Township. 52 square miles of former cow pasture where we've lost builder's remedy suit after builder remedy suit after builder remedy suit. And we see highdensity housing going up in a community where there is no mass transit, where there is no infrastructure, where there is no sewer capacity, and where there are no jobs, per se. And what we only end up with is more idling cars on our already congested roads and higher property taxes. For the last three years, I've lived in a transit hub. That's Somerville, New Jersey, where there is mass tra mass transit, a Rarent Valley train line, a New Jersey transit bus line, where there are large employers, county government, a hospital, a court system, and one mile of Main Street with mom and pop shops that all employ anywhere from five up to 40 people each. We've gone up with highdensity housing in downtown SRL. And it's created a diverse and vibrant local community that is now self- sustaining and no longer dependent upon state aid for its schools or its municipal budget. That is the right approach to addressing the highdensity housing crisis across New Jersey. Is there a shortage? Do more young people need affordable housing? Do our elderly need affordable housing? our disabled people and our veterans. You bet they do. But we need to do this in a way that is more consistent with sustainability. I'd also like to point out that I believe this is one of the two most hypocritical positions the Democratic party will take. They'll often like to portray themselves as the party that is pro- environment. There is nothing pro- environment. There is nothing consistent with sustainability when we're using eminent domain to condemn open space to build more highdensity housing. Nothing. I just find it to be a very very hypocritical position. And so I will continue to talk about this issue no matter where it is I go around the state. I applaud Assemblyman Ziki for the bill that he's put in place. I do not expect it to get traction amongst the Democratic majority. I think the uh the livestock agrees with me here with what I'm saying. They don't want to see this farm go by the wayside either. Tim, thank you for fighting the fight. Thank you. Joe and Marty who are on the ticket this year for state assembly in this district. Thank you. I think we've got a county commissioner candidate here. Do we not? Sheriff. Sheriff. Sheriff. Sorry. Good to see you again, Peter. Uh but Alex, thank you for your leadership. Thank you. And so with that, we'll open up for questions. Uh Jack, if you're if you're governor, what specific actions would you take to preserve this farm? Specifically, are there any executive actions you can take on that? Would you I will take any and all actions that prevent eminent domain to be used to condemn open space. We should be preserving open space here in New Jersey. Every chance we get, not condemning it. And by the way, property rights are sacred in this country. Eminent domain is like fire. Use it the wrong way, you get burned. But it can be a very powerful tool. It was always meant to give municipalities leverage to address blight. I don't see a whole lot of blight. I see what New Jerseyians want to see. More open space. Let's let's stop taking garden out of the Garden State. Would you be open to a citizen uh ballot initiative process? Potentially one that could lead to constitutional amendment to reverse Mount Mo or other forms. Would you support a process like that? Listen, in the end, we need change here in New Jersey. And if initiative referendum, ballot reference is the way to go, we certainly should take advantage of it. Not just when it comes to the Mount Laurel housing doctrine, but also when it comes to school funding, but I'll be looking for Supreme Court justice that agree with me on those two issues. Um, a little topic, but how important do you think black and Hispanic voters are to I'm sorry. How important do you think blackers are? Okay, next question. Charlie, I'm going to take you out of the penalty box. Don't tell me you're illprepared. Off topic question. Let's stick it Let's stick to the topic at hand first here. Okay. authorities in the chambers to do that. What districts are you hoping will give you? I'm certainly open to any and all options available to the governor, uh, which I hope to be and plan to be. Uh, we do know the New Jersey state governor is the New Jersey governorship is the most powerful in in the nation by state constitution. Um, but listen, as I go around this state, I find a lot of Democrats agree with me on this issue. And when you see Republicans winning in towns that are overwhelmingly Democratic over this issue, it tells you that people are having a wakeup call and people want us to stop with the overdevelopment of our suburban communities. That's what's taking place here across New Jersey. So if you don't have a majority, it is a law. What can you do? What I can do is a couple things. uh number one, go before the state supreme court on day one with my attorney general and make the argument that what we're seeing with all this highdensity housing is inconsistent with D policies when it comes to sore capacity and storm water management. This overdevelopment is I want to repeat this. There are regulations at the D that the manner in which that we approach high highdensity housing, it's inconsistent with those regulations, particularly on things like storm water management and uh sewer capacity. So let's point out to our Supreme Court that we over here we're doing housing policy that is in violation of D regulations over here. The second thing that we can do is I do get the opportunity if I have the privilege of serving uh for two terms, two new Supreme Court state justices, one of which is the chief justice. And I've said all along I'm not appointing anybody that doesn't agree with me on the two issues of highdensity housing and school funding. But third, I plan to sit down with the leadership in the legislature, whoever that might be at the time, to talk about this issue. And I think there is a lot of support in the legislature for a different approach to how we address the affordable housing crisis across New Jersey. So let's have that discussion and see what we come up with. You know, when I was in the 16th Legislative District, I represented 14 towns. And there were towns like Raron Township and Hillsboro Township, Republican controlled, that agreed with the leadership in townships like Montgomery and Princeton, Democratically controlled, on what was going on and what was happening to our suburban communities. And if we can have a meetings of minds at that level amongst people from different parties that are leading up our towns, I think we can do it in the legislature. New York Times. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were signaling. No, never mind. Daniel, I have I have an off topic for you. Um, the Murphy administration has taken steps to expand access to vaccines. Would you keep those in place for your governor? Uh, I'm not familiar with exactly what he's done on CO 19 vaccines. Um, overdevelopment. Lots more. I'm sorry. It's my topic, man. Yeah, let's do it. Um, so where do you put the housing then? You want to put it in places like a Somerville. When we talk about providing more highdensity housing, which we need to do, when we talk about doing that consistent with smart growth strategies, what we're talking about is putting it in places like a Somerville, which is designated as a transit hub because it has a Ritton Valley train line, because it has a New Jersey Transit bus line, because it's got infrastructure, because it has jobs. The goal should be to put fewer idling cars on our roads. Uh congestion is also an issue in the state. And let me be clear, a lot of the congestion you see on municipal and county roads today that you didn't see 10, 15 to 20 years ago, a lot of the flooding that you see today is not just that the rainfall is different. It's due to the overdevelopment. Uh last month, I think it was up in Union County, we saw flooding in places like Scotch Plains, Fanwood, and Westfield that we had never seen before. It has all to do with the overdevelopment that's taking place. regional contribution agreements, the ending of that. The problem with those were that they allowed towns to completely wash their hands of their responsibility and just offer a paycheck to urban areas. Charlie, it's no secret that I'm an advocate for the regional contribution agreements, the RCAs. Uh I do believe we should approach high density and affordable housing on a more regional basis. That is not to say that rural communities like this one shouldn't have a skin in the game. We know that every type of development there's a fee that goes into the affordable housing trust fund and everyone should have a skin in the game in terms of making the housing affordable. Okay. But um but that doesn't mean we should be put in a community such as this nor should we be condemning this farm. Now I know there are those who don't like RCAs that will claim that that is a form of exclusionary zoning. Oh, they don't want that in their town. The biggest challenge we have with the builder remedy suits is that when the fourth round quotas came along, the mandate, and said that any town has to have 100 affordable housing units, the developer comes along and says, \"Well, in order for me to afford a 100 units, I have to put up 500 units.\" Therein lies the problem. So, I'm a advocate for RCA's because I think we need to do it consistent with smart growth strategies, but we also need a different economic model and that's where we have to come up with another solution so that we don't have to put up 500 units in order to accommodate the 100 affordable housing units. Fred Jack, how about like regional planning as opposed to giving letting planning decisions be made by the local planning board? How about like giving the county planning board more teeth? Every single county government in this state has a county planning board. I always felt we did a damn good job in Somerset County of regional planning and you saw that with the very unique relationship between Bridgewater, Raritton and Somerville where planning took place on a regional basis. So yes, but listen the whole point another important point here that should not be lost. We really need to drive population growth in this state toward our major urban centers. You know, I was in Atlantic City recently and they were lamenting the fact that there were so many empty storefronts on Atlantic Avenue. And I understand that there are 72 to be exact. And when I got up to speak, I said, \"Did anybody know what the population of this city was 100 years ago?\" 100 years ago, the population of Atlantic City was 55,000. Today, it's 35,000. What would 20,000 more people mean to the local economy? The mom and pop shops. If Atlantic City could easily accommodate 55,000 people in 1925 in in 1925, don't you think they could accommodate the same number of people, if not more, in 2025? How would you incentivize the increase in population in those? I believe that people will live where there are a few things compelling and affordable housing, safe communities, good educational choices, and recreational opportunities. And we've seen this happen in some of our towns. If you look at Somerville today and compare it to where it was 15 years ago, you might not believe your eyes. It was a community plagued by blight. It was a community that was dependent on state aid because it couldn't balance its own local budgets. Take a look at what we've done in Somerville. It's diverse. It's vibrant. Low, moderate, and market rates are all in there together because I don't believe that we should be putting the highdensity affordable housing units in the corner of town. Mom and pop shops opening left and right downtown. And now, best part for the next governor, Jack Cedarelli, they don't need any help from the state budget. It's a local self-sustaining economy. Do you know how they got there? Like what was the impetus? We convinced the community that we needed to go up with four, five, and sixtory buildings on Main Street. We got the community to buy into the need for redevelopment zones to attract developers with capital. We used a URG an urban renewal grant from the state of New Jersey to bring in the anchor which is the super the super shop so that we wouldn't have a food desert. These are all things that we need to do and we can do. And by the way, Sville is not the first. Take a look at downtown New Brunswick. Take a look at downtown Morristown. Is there concern on your part that southern development are places like this opport? I believe that it's up to the mayor, the local leadership to determine how economic growth should take place in their town. Uh but it should not be by state mandate. What was happening here was as a result of a state mandate. Now I disagree with the local leadership using eminent domain. This was not the purpose or the spirit of the eminent domain law. It was to address blight. There's no blight here. There's open space and we need open space here in the state of New Jersey. He agrees. Question. President Gateway. So, Governor Chidarelli, what are you doing this this instance? This is a major economic project in this area. We've seen shutdowns before at the federal level, Charlie. There's a negotiation that's taking place, but if you take a close look at the Gateway project, which is managed by the Gateway Commission, that project does not stop because of this shutdown. It continues. Does this how does this affect your campaign? Does this give your opponent the opportunity to say, \"Look, this this is an example of how Trump is bringing harm to New Jersey.\" I think you need credibility in order for someone to believe what you're saying. I don't think my opponent has a whole lot of credibility at this point. Have you reached out to the White House or Secretary just to make that there are no delays on on I reached out to confirm something what I had believed and I confirmed it to be true. The gateway project is man managed by the gateway commission and just because there was shutdown doesn't mean the shovels didn't go in the ground yesterday, today or tomorrow. That project continues. All right, we got to do one more here, guys. So, thank you very much. Anything else on overdevelopment?",

    "transcript_text": "10/02/2025 - Ciattarelli - ChatBox Good to be back, David. Thank you. So are you comfortable with how all this went down, leaked to your campaign, then to a news site that put out the other part of the story that worked to your advantage? David, it's unfortunate that the National Archives screwed up when they fulfilled a Freedom of Information Act request, perfectly legal to ask for freedom of information in New Jersey. It's unfortunate that when they did they they didn't redact certain information And so and they've apologized they took responsibility for what they did and they apologized nothing illegal has been done But this is all the smokescreen and spin. Here's the bottom line There was a cheating scandal at the Naval Academy in 1994 my opponent was involved in it and she was punished. She wasn't allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony. Her name did not appear in the commencement exercise program. She says it's because she didn't want to turn in her her classmates. I don't think that's true but the way to prove that it is true and what the truth really is all she has to do is approve the release of her disciplinary records and if what she is saying is true why the hesitancy in releasing the records and by the way she didn't want to turn in her fellow mates who were cheating what is she going to do when she gets to Trenton as governor and finds people who are gaming the system or doing wrong by New Jersey taxpayers. You said she was involved what does that mean? She was punished for a reason why was she punished? She says it's because she wasn't going to turn her classmates. Then the story took a little bit of a pivot and she said it was because she knew that there was a test that was circulating prior to the actual test being taken. All she has to do is approve the release of her disciplinary records. Don't know what the big deal is. If she's telling the truth, those records will say exactly what she's saying and it's over and done with. It doesn't change the fact that she was punished. What did she do that was so wrong that we know of that disqualifies her for the governor's job? Are you saying that what's in these records may be what disqualifies her for the governor's job? I think if you're not being transparent about a time that you were punished, particularly at one of our military academies, I think the people of New Jersey deserve the right to know exactly why you were punished. And the release of her disciplinary records would reveal that. Yeah. So lots of wild speculation, as you may have guessed, on social media, where wild speculation goes. Well, David, I mean, listen, not the first time we've seen a lack of transparency here. I mean, as congressperson, she did violate federal law with regard to stock trades and stock reporting. The New York Times reports that while sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she was trading defense stocks. Are we beginning to see a pattern here? You're saying that she purposely and knowingly changed, exchanged stocks or bought stocks or sold stocks while she was doing work in Congress that involved military contracts. You're saying she knowingly did this. David, even if it's not illegal, it doesn't pass the sniff test that while sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, the New York Times reports that she was trading defense stocks. What do you expect we'll learn if she does release these records? You know, there's lots of wild speculation that I was saying. What do you think is in there? Listen, I think it could be a couple of things other than what it is that she's saying. What she's saying is that she was punished because she wouldn't turn in her classmates. If that's the case, let's see the disciplinary records. They probably say something else. That's why she doesn't want to release them. Well, you say they probably say something else. What do you think they probably say? David, I'll leave it up to you to speculate, but my guess is it's a whole lot worse than not turning in your classmates. All right. Don't you think our privacy has been invaded enough? National Archives is taking responsibility and apologized for what they did. You also know, Assemblyman, that the public is very cynical and they know that the President of the United States, that this is not something that would be beyond the President of the United States to orchestrate for a guy who he supports for governor. David, if you're cynical, you're inclined to believe anything. But I will tell you, it's a huge smokescreen and spin to think that it was the President of the United States that got involved in fulfilling a very simple Freedom of Information Act. That's almost like saying that I as governor would get involved with you making an OPA request of a small community in one of our 21 counties. Come on. All right, let's move on to some policy stuff here. The shutdown, right? Let's just go ahead and blame the President, right? Because I mean, he says it's on the President. Well, there's nothing my opponent won't blame on the President. As I always say to people, if you get a flat tire today, it's the President's fault. Listen, a shutdown is unfortunate. Let's hope that they, this is a negotiation. It's not like we haven't seen this kind of thing before. I've just learned of it. I've been in meetings all day. What I have also learned is that there is a bipartisan group that is doing everything they can to avert the shutdown. And my opponent has decided not to be part of that bipartisan group to avert it. She'd rather vote no and that's exactly what she did. All right. So how do you get my $600 a month electrical bill down to what was an already ridiculous $200 a month that it used to be? Can you really tell people that the governor is going to make that kind of change? You bet I can. I'll tell you how in a second. Let me tell you how I can't. By declaring a state of emergency to freeze electricity rates at an all-time high rate. Why would we freeze them here? We want them back here. And you have 77 sitting Democratic legislators, 52 of which are on the ballot this year, and not one of them has endorsed that illegitimate plan put forth by my opponent that even the governor has said on TV. I don't think you can do that. Here's how we do it, David. We pull out a reggie. The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is a carbon tax policy that has failed New Jersey. Murphy put us in. Seven and a half years later, electricity is no less expensive. The air is no cleaner and half a billion dollars a year is going to other states for their grid, not ours. The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is not in Reggie. We won't be either on day one of my administration. I could save half a billion dollars a year for ratepayers, for homeowners, tenants and businesses by pulling out of Reggie. rbon tax policy. So Reggie pulling out of Reggie is is going to take my rate down back to where it's usually. There'll be less charges on your bill. And in addition to that I've got to repurpose the six plants that Phil Murphy shut down. I've got to accelerate solar on the rooftops of all this warehousing across the state which is prime real estate. Talk to any solar developer about what Murphy's DEP does to slow that down. I want to expand our nuclear capability in South Jersey. I want to build three or four more new natural gas fire electricity generation plants. I want to lift the moratorium on the existing plants and we can be an exporter once again. I mean when Phil Murphy took off as we were an importer we were an exporter of electricity. Today we have to import it. Buy it through exchanges competing with a whole bunch of other states and that's the why electricity is through the roof. To my opponent my president is just another blatant lie in this campaign. It's all at the hands and the feet of the current administration. Let me make one thing perfectly clear. While he was shutting down everything that was producing electricity, he bet it all on wind. And seven and a half years later, show me a single wind turbine off the Jersey Shore producing electricity. It's been a failure. His entire energy policy has been a failure. And right now, New Jerseyans are paying through the nose. So you talk about nuclear and getting some of these plants that were shuttered back online. Is that going to require some kind of regulatory changes in the state that environmentalists may want to know about? My goodness, environmentalists should be very happy about the fact that when we reopen them, we won't use coal, we'll use natural gas. Yeah. There's already feeds that are already there. So, listen, we need a rational transition to the future. There are some people on the left that won't be happy with any fossil fuels being burned. I mean, the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is burning seven coal-burning plants, natural gas like there's no tomorrow, just cut the ribbon on a new nuclear reactor. He's got the juice, it's abundant, it's reliable, it's cost effective. So not only is your monthly bill down, but he's getting economic development opportunities that we're not, including the data centers that are needed to support AI. That's a whole lot of jobs. All right, let's talk about your tax cut policies. Do you distinguish between taxes, by the way, and fees? Right, because I know you're going to say you're going to cut taxes, but a lot of times elected officials say, \"Hey, we're going to cut taxes,\" and then they raise your fees over here, so it kind of evens out. You see it, you separate those two, right? David, let me say this. The middle class is being crushed today like never before. People at the lower rungs of the ladder are having trouble climbing, and it has everything to do with the affordability in crisis and all the fares and fees and taxes that have been raised over the last eight years. I'm going to very responsibly and surgically reduce the size and cost of our state government to afford a tax cut for individuals and businesses on the income tax side. With a new school funding formula, we can reduce property taxes. We're not increasing the sales tax. It's a blatant lie by my opponent, and we're not increasing fares or fees. We've got to make New Jersey affordable again. Government plays a role here, and part of it is to reduce the tax burden. New Jerseyans have the highest overall tax burden in the country. It needs to change. So how do you pay for that? I mean, you're talking about five or six different tax cuts there. You're going to reduce the size of government that much that you're going to we're going to be paying less so much less for it? A couple things I hope we can have a whole nother half hour to talk about the ways of making New Jersey a better place to do business when we do that we grow the economy that means there's more businesses paying the old tax not the new tax more people who are employed that means more income and sales tax because we're growing the base but the other point I'll make here is it took 238 years 238 years as a state to get the $36 billion state budget and in eight years we went from 36 billion to 59 billion a 70% increase if your property taxes were down if your income taxes were down if your electricity bill was down if your schools were performing magnificently and there wasn't overdevelopment in our suburban communities and our cities were vibrant you know what I would do I'd tip my cap to the Democratic opponents say it's all yours things are great here in New Jersey but they're not in my 64 years they've never been worse do you for instance when you're talking about budget cutting and budget right sizing do you keep programs like stay NJ and anchor I want to combine them we need property tax relief particularly for our seniors but I like programs that are fair and easy to administrate there's one aspect of one of those programs you just rattled off that to me I mean we're gonna send a property tax rebate check to people that are making five hundred thousand dollars a year I mean I know their property taxes are high and I'm not condemning them for earning that kind of money but we've got a whole lot of people that are struggling I think we should point the money mostly to the people who are struggling the most but if we freeze property taxes for everyone once they hit 870 if we make all retirement income tax-free the way it is in Pennsylvania if we allow you to deduct 100% of your New Jersey property taxes on your New Jersey tax return if we cap property taxes at 1% of the assessed value of the home for first-time homebuyers you know we can help a whole lot of people and with a new school funding formula we can help all those people in the middle too by lowering their property tax which is exactly what I'll work like hell to do. I move on to public safety you have a lieutenant governor who's in law enforcement or lieutenant governor candidate who's in law enforcement and you talk a lot about taking the handcuffs off of our cops what does that mean exactly? Well first of all what it means is not having an immigrant trust directive so no town in our state will be a sanctuary city will not be a sanctuary state. I believe that only encourages illegal immigration and it does handcuff our police in a number of different ways one of which is the administration of warrants. And the second thing is if any mayor feels that to keep his or her community safe they want their local PD to work in partnership with federal agency I don't think I should take that right away from them. But it also means getting rid of reform in bail reform. Cashless bail has created a professional criminal who's learned how to game the system and Talk to your local police arrest release repeat is real. What would you change about violent crime? Nonviolent crime is spiky. We have car thefts. We have break-ins Flash mobs on the Jersey Shore and at our malls Did you see what happened in Secaucus four weeks ago? Total lack of regard for law and order, total lack of respect for law enforcement. You're kind of conflating a couple of things there. You're talking about bail reform and then you talk about kids wilding in their cars. Let me ask you about bail reform. What would you change? You asked me, you know, how do we take the handcuffs off? First of all, we have to create an environment in which we respect law and order and respect law enforcement. But in terms of taking the handcuffs off, I don't have a problem with no-knock warrants. I don't have a problem with canines for crowd control. I don't have a problem necessarily with high-speed chases. We're not getting rid of qualified immunity, which my opponent voted yes on. These are all the things that make the job of local law enforcement harder. Why would we do that? As I go around the state of New Jersey, people want safe communities. The way to do that is by taking these handcuffs off, I just gave you four, and let them do their job. They're trained professionals. What about the other side of that, from communities that have been over-policed, and you, for instance, are being against or being for restrictions on public access to internal affairs records and being against community reform boards. David, if you did something seriously wrong at your place of business where you're employed, do you think it's fair that your employer make that your personnel records public going forward or backward? These are human resource issues. Now listen, are there bad cops? There's bad CPAs. There's bad doctors. I'm a bad broadcaster, but I'm not putting cuffs on people. Hey, here's the one thing that those who kind of go down this road never want to seem to mention. Every single law enforcement officer in this state has a body camera on that records everything. Everything. And anyone who's been violated is entitled to that video becoming public. That's good enough for me. But if there is for some reason a guy you know they don't always put on their their cameras or something happens to it shouldn't there be a venue for an investigation into all of that? Absolutely. There should never not be a venue for investigation. But do we take somebody's personnel records and make them public? Why do we want to shame cops? All right. So you spoke at the New Jersey Public Health Innovation PAC event, I guess this week or last week. The group is is far along on the anti-vax spectrum. It called into question just what vaccines you think should be mandated or what your vaccine policies would be. David, I vaccinated all four of my children. I would recommend that parents get their children vaccinated. The advocacy that you're referring to is really very passionate about two things. One of which is informed consent. Our parents being completely informed about vaccines. And also the other thing they're very concerned about is the volume of vaccines that are given in a very short period of time. Things are very different today in terms of the volumes of vaccines that a child gets compared to when you and I were children. And so I think those are fair things to discuss. Here in New Jersey we have a medical exemption. Here in New Jersey we also have a religious exemption. And I think the Democrats seem to have no problem with that because they've controlled the Assembly the Senate and the executive branch for the past eight years and they haven't tried to change it. They're in a perfectly perfect position to reform that if they wanted to and they haven't. So obviously they agree with a lot of what those people at that gala are advocating for. I want to talk a little bit about Donald Trump because I know you expect me to ask about Donald Trump. I'd be disappointed if you didn't. Exactly. So how do you think he's doing for New Jersey excluding killing the wind industry and congestion pricing? Excluding? Excluding those things because I know that's two things that you always go to. So I want to say yes, fine. What else you got? Well let's talk about the big beautiful bill for a second. This quadruples the SALT deduction, the ability to deduct state and local taxes now up to $40,000 on your federal tax return. It was $10,000, it's now $40,000. That's really important in a state that has the highest property tax in the nation. It doubles the child care tax credit for families with young kids. It doesn't tax tips, overtime or social security. It tax credit for those who send their kids to private school. I know you're going to run through a list of things I got you but a lot of these tax cuts for instance No tax on tips etc those things sunset a lot of the other corporate taxes. They don't sunset Well the things that I just rattled off are really important to New Jersey for the next few years. What I'm saying is that this big beautiful bill is big and beautiful for those who already got things going pretty good and not so big and beautiful long term or longer term for those who don't have it so good. David I'm gonna respectfully disagree when I talk to parents about what they're having to pay out of pocket for child care. It's one of those things we don't talk about enough with regard to New Jersey's affordability crisis, but I will tell you that parents are paying anywhere between $10,000 and $20,000 a year for child care. And as a CPA, let me tell you, that's net pay. You got to earn $23,000 to $24,000 to $25,000 in gross to afford those kind of bills. That child care tax credit is huge. And for those who send their kids to private school, let's not forget about the private school tax credit. It starts in 2027 and your governor has to opt in. My opponent won't because he's owned by the NJEA. Could you in one minute explain how you would change the school funding formula and how it would be different? You bet I will. You bet the state's going to take over the cost of special education. Go ahead, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. The state's going to ° take over the cost of special education in our school districts. It's causing a crowding out effect, also causes disparity in the quality of special ed from one district to the next. We can't have that. Next, every district gets X for every English speaking student, X plus for every English language learner because that student is a bit more educationally intensive, and then every district for their non-special ed students better be in a reasonable range, somewhere between $14,000 and $20,000 a year. And if they're not, they'll lose their state aid because if they're not, they're wasting taxpayer dollars. I want a quick answer to this one as well because I had a lot of stuff I'm not going to be able to get to. It's Taylor Ham. I'm with you on that one, by the way. NJ Transit, is it going to kill you before you fix it? Nope. I'm creating the Garden State Transportation Authority and all of our mass transit systems will be under one roof. The Atlantic City Expressway, the Parkway, the Turnpike, New Jersey Transit, they all produce revenue. We'll have a dedicated revenue stream called the New Jersey State Budget. We'll put that under one management structure, greater accountability, greater transparency. But I will say this with regard to New Jersey Transit, I'm always very transparent, we need to reevaluate every single train and bus line. And those that do not have adequate ridership, we're going to have to make some tough decisions so we can dedicate the limited resources we have to the routes that provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of commuters. All right one way of hearing that I think is saying that you're going to cut off some routes that aren't maybe serving a lot of people but a lot of times those kind of routes are in rural areas and where people have a hard time getting around. David we are a sprawl state we can't be people the more we try the more we raise taxes and fares we are dying a slow death by a thousand cuts here in New Jersey we need change we need a hands-on CEO governor that's going to make the bold decisions to point us in a different direction we can't afford another four years of what the past eight have been all right I can't let you get out of here without saying mentioning the story that was big for us for a little bit so WNET which operates and NJPBS that's us is ending its relationship with the state at the end of June it'll be up to the next governor to determine the future of the state's public broadcasting if you're the guy what are some of the the the parameters that you would like to see from a successor to NJ PBS and do you have anyone in mind now David if the next governor governor Ciattarelli is going to agree to subsidize PBS and I'm not saying that I am because there's some difficult decisions we need to make but if I were I'd prefer see a PBS that's broadcasting New Jersey news and not necessarily the BBC or anything outside the United States. We're using taxpayer dollars here. I think that's a reasonable conversation and a reasonable request. Well, I'm not even talking about subsidizing it, which didn't occur until like four years ago. And it's not even about NJPBS. It's about what's next. What the state is going to set with the parameters for a public broadcaster. Are you cool with what the parameters are now? I'm not familiar with what the parameters are now, David. All I will tell you is that everything is going to be evaluated. But one thing I will tell you about the next budget, in the last 24 months we've had more than $2 billion in pet pork projects here in New Jersey. State government under Governor Ciattarelli is not going to be paying for French art museums or turf fields in anybody's backyard. We're not doing that anymore. How do you do that? How do you stop the legislature from putting a billion dollars into the budget the day before it goes to a vote? David, as you know, the New Jersey governorship is the most powerful in the nation by state constitution. That's a fact. And one of the executive powers given to our governor when they redrew the constitution in 1947 is simply this. I've got line item veto. And he's not afraid to use it folks. All right. Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli. Always good to see you man. We'll see you out there. All right David. Thank you.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 3 - Ciattarelli - NJGovernorsForum  And welcome back to Pix 11 form with the New Jersey gubanatorial candidates. Before the break, we heard from Democrat Mikey Cheryl. And now it's time to hear from the Republican in the race, Jack Chidarelli. A native New Jersey resident. He is a longtime entrepreneur and small business owner. For nearly seven years, he served in the New Jersey state legislature and made his first run for governor in 2017. This is the second time he is now the Republican nominee. So, please welcome to the stage a Republican nominee for governor of New Jersey, Jack Chidarelli.  Looking forward to a good competition. Absolutely. We got a great audience who always All right, Mr. Cherelli. So, you ready to go? Well, only if you call me Jack. Okay, I'll call you Jack. Let's get right into it. You know, this week we hosted the Lieutenant Governor debate right here on this very stage. and your running mate James Ganon. I want you to take a listen to what he had to say right here about potential taxes. Is a millionaire's tax on the table in your administration if you win. Taxes are on the table. Taxes are on the table. So what are the taxes on the table that Mr. Ganon's speaking of? He's lieutenant governor. I'm the governor. There will be no tax increases in New Jersey. I have a very specific plan on how to reduce income taxes and property taxes. Those are most burdensome of all. So, why is your running mate opening the door to the conversation about taxes? Did he misspeak? Um, I don't want to speak for Jim. I mean, it was his first first time on the debate stage. Lieutenant Governor, taxes are one of the big things you've been talking about. And he opens the door. Hey, at the last debate, my opponent when asked, she said with regard to taxes, I'm not going to commit myself to anything despite the fact that she's telling the people of New Jersey, I'm raising sales tax to 10%. Which she knows is a blatant lie. Yeah. So, you're saying absolutely no taxes. What about the idea which the original question was about a millionaire's tax and whether or not that would be on the table? My goodness. Our top tax bracket is 10.75. Pennsylvania's is 3%. Do we or do we not want to compete? Our top's business tax rate is now 11 and a half. Pennsylvania's is on its way down to five. We've got to be regionally competitive. We don't want to be chasing people out of New Jersey. We don't want to be chasing businesses out of New Jersey. We need to grow our economy. And I think we need more competitive and regionally competitive tax rates for not only individuals, but also for businesses. So, just to be clear and and put an end to this, taxes are off the table. Increases in taxes are off the table. One of the reasons why we have an affordability crisis in New Jersey is taxes. There's three other reasons, but taxes is one of them. All right. At a recent debate, when asked about efforts to desegregate New Jersey schools, you were questioned whether this would be an issue of discussion if predominantly black schools outperformed white schools. So, let me ask you, does segregation play a role in the disparity of education among New Jersey? I think failing school systems is what plays a role when our students are not performing well. And my job on day one is to fix that. We do that with a new public education curriculum and we'll get that under a different state board of education under Governor Chedarelli. But we also desperately need something that Louisiana and Mississippi have deployed. It's called a high impact curriculum. If a child is behind grade level in reading, writing, and math, we're going to spend the entire next market period and the one thereafter focusing just on those skills. I will tell you as an NBA CP, I'm pretty much a data guy. The data is pretty clear. If a kid comes out of eighth grade below grade level in reading, writing, math, more than likely they'll be undermployed their entire life. So, do you think segregation plays a role at all? Listen, we'd all want more diversified schools. We'd all want more diversified communities. Uh but my job is to fix the public education system. When I talk to people in predominantly Latino or or African-American communities, it's not that they want their kids to go to another school. They want their current schools to succeed. But let me say this, we also need school choice. And that's why I've promoted vouchers and charter schools. This administration's only approved one charter school in its eight years. And the ones that were all approved by Chris Christie in the eight years before in places like Camden and NORC and I visited one of them recently are doing phenomenal. Yeah, but not all families have the option, right, for a charter school, they can't afford to go to a charter school. So what is your plan to help them with the public school? Well, you don't pay to go to a charter school, you pay to go to private school, which points out one of the great hypocrisies of the Democratic party. They'll constantly want to portray themselves as the party of the marginalized and disadvantaged and minorities. Who can afford private school? People with money. People with money have school choice. People without money don't have school choice. Let's give those people a choice. Charters and vouchers provides the choice. So, let me talk about what's happening in real time right now. We're in day three of this government shutdown. And as the as the party in day three, day three of a government shutdown. And as the party in power, how do Republicans make this the least painful shutdown for a New Jersey resident? There's a negotiation taking place in uh in Washington DC. I hope it's resolved soon because we know this does impact people each and every day. Um interestingly enough, when there were government shutdowns during the Biden era, my opponent supported resolutions to continue the operation of the government, but this time around she's voting no on those same resolutions. Let's hope it's resolved sometime soon. What would you urge some of the Republicans to negotiate on? Is there wiggle room in terms of the negotiations? I just hope all the parties get together, which speaks to something else I really want to do as governor. I feel like our 14 member delegation, congressional delegation, 12 House members, two US senators. It's 14 people running in 14 different directions at time. What I plan to do as governor is meet with them once a month, try to galvanize them. And if the 15 of us can say, \"These are three things that are critically important to New Jersey. Let's get this done.\" And uh my hope is that with that kind of leadership, we can get our congressional delegation to work more together. And what's also playing out in real time, President Trump said the administration is withholding roughly $18 billion dollars right now in infrastructure projects, including the Gateway Tunnel project. And for those who don't know, it's that tunnel that connects New York and New Jersey, would provide extra rail service, expected to employ thousands of union jobs. Now, it's expected to be challenged in court, but how would you keep this project funded, and should it be? So, the Gateway project is managed by the Gateway Commission. The Gateway Commission provides the funding and then goes back to the federal government for reimbursement. That project's not going to stop anytime soon. This shutdown would have to go on for at least two or three months before you'd see a slowdown or shut down. The president was saying it's not related to the shutdown that it's related to DEI policies and that's why he's withholding that money. This is part of the government shutdown in my opinion. I know the president says a lot of different things. Uh but we'll get that funding. This shutdown will end. If you had to challenge the president to get some of that money back that he's withholding a lot of these clawbacks, would you sue to get that money to fund this project? I don't need to stew the White House to get things done. I have a relationship with the president unlike my opponent. And um you know, it reminds me of during the pandemic when we were running low on ventilators and the ERs were overfilled. Phil Murphy went to the White House and exchanged all kinds of nicities with the president. He got his ventilators. The president came through. This is a relationship business. I've got a relationship with the White House. We'll get things done for the benefit of New Jersey. And you would say release the money. Absolutely. Listen, my job as governor is to advocate for our 9.3 million citizens. I've probably been one of the most independent Republicans in this entire state. I've called on prominent Republicans across the country resign. I called on Chris Christie resign. Um there are there are times that I've stood up to my party. I'll do what's right by the people of New Jersey. I'm the governor for all the people. Hey, I want to talk about an important topic of transit as we talk about the Gateway Tunnel. And our senior political reporter for Pixel 11, Henry Rostoff has this question. I want you to take a listen right here. New Jersey transit is upping fairs 3% annually for the foreseeable future. If you're elected governor, would you stop the fair increase? And if so, how would you make sure New Jersey Transit has the money to keep commuters moving? So, the first thing I want to do as part of my reorganization of state government, do what other states have done. We're going to create the Garden State Transportation Authority, put all of our mass transit systems under one roof. That's Atlantic City Expressway and its revenue, the Parkway, the Turnpike and its toll revenue, New Jersey Transit and its fair revenue. Now, one management structure, better accountability, better transparency. And for New Jersey Transit, what we're going to do is it's time to re-evaluate every single train and bus line to make sure it has adequate ridership. And we'll cancel ones that don't and dedicate all of our resources to the lines that pro that provide service to the greatest number of computer commuters. Now, I know that goes against the grain of some people, but I'm all about transparency. But it's time to make these kind of tough decisions, and I believe with the subsidy we provide from the state budget, we won't have to raise fairs. So you're saying you would stop those annual fair. I think we could be put ourselves in a position to do that. A lot of questions about Chris Calori whether he's doing a good job. Do you think he's doing a good job? Would you keep him as the president of New Jersey Transit? I think it would be under consideration. I um I have great faith in Chris's talents and I know he's all about improving our mass transit systems. I want to talk about what's really been in the headlines and I just asked your opponent when she was here on the stage about the release of her personal information from the National Archives. She was sitting here accusing you of obtaining and distributing that information. some of those files, those unredacted files. How do you respond to that? So, it is unfortunate that somebody for uh provided or put in to the National Archives a Freedom of Information Act request. The same the equivalent of that here in New Jersey is an Oprah. It's unfortunate that when the National Archives fulfilled that request uh that they didn't redact certain information. They've taken responsibility and they've apologized. Here are the facts. Okay? There was a cheating scandal at the Naval Academy in 1994. My opponent was part of that cheating scandal. It's why she was punished. She was not allowed to walk in the graduation ceremony and her name's not listed in the commencement exercise program. These are the facts. She says it's because she didn't turn in her classmates. I don't think that's the truth. The real truth is in her disciplinary records, which she can release only with her approval. If she do that, we'll find out whether or not she's telling the truth. So those um those military service records that were released by the archives, it did have that unredacted information. Did you or any member of your campaign obtain those records that were unredacted and then distribute them to members of the media or elsewhere like she had just said here? Opposition research takes place all the time. My opponent's done a whole bunch of opposition research on me. Uh there's a team that's responsible for opposition research. It did make its way into the press, so I'm sure at some point did it make its way to the Chidarella campaign. Did anybody in your campaign get those files and then disseminate? Yeah, that I don't know, Dan. There's there's a team that's responsible for opposition research. I don't engage with that team. So, you yourself never saw those files? I never saw those files, nor did I put the requests in. And anybody that states otherwise is lying. If somebody in your campaign did, should they have had an obligation to call and say, \"Hey, we have these unredacted files.\" I think what probably happened is that the National Archives fulfilled the Freedom of Information Act request. And when you get the information came from your campaign, it was that filed the request, it ended up in a pile of documents. And when you get the document from the federal government that you requested, who knows who's looking how closely at that. It's an unfortunate situation. The National Archives has taken responsibility for it and apologize. But you're not saying that it was your campaign that filed that. I don't engage with my opposition research team and I doubt if my opponent engages with hers. Understood. I want to talk about a big issue for New Jersey which I know you're all familiar with and that is property taxes. And you've said you want to cap property taxes to a percentage of a home value as well as freeze property taxes once you hit the age of 70. Just two examples. But as you know, property taxes are largely controlled by schools and towns and not the governor. So how would you get that done? I would respectfully disagree. Um 15 to 20% of any property tax bill is the municipal tax. 15 to 20% is the county tax, which means 60 to 70% is the school tax. And that school tax most times is a function of how much state aid you do or don't get in your district. We've got a very arbitrary, nefarious, and I believe unconstitutional state school funding formula. And so I want a more equitable distribution of state aid to our districts. The more state aid your school district gets, the less it has to tax. So if I send more school aid to your school district, you don't have to tax as much. We just lowered your property tax bill. So you're talking about combining services? No, I'm talking about a more equitable distribution of state aid to our school districts. The more state aid you get, the less the levy. The less the levy, the less the property tax. So let me talk about on schools. Yeah, I understand. And in New Jersey, there are currently 590 school districts, which is is more than the number of municipalities. Now, you said you don't want to force consolidation. You wouldn't mandate it, but you would incentivize it through money. So, what if a school district doesn't take you up on that offer, right? You haven't getting get the buyin that you need. How many school districts would there be at the end of a four-year term? Would the number still be 590? I'm going to incentivize the hell out of it. This really worked when I was a legislator in Princeton Burough and Princeton Township decided to combine become one Princeton. When there is a combination, there's a lot of one-time upfront costs that really shouldn't be bonded for, but if you put them in the first year operating budget, you get a spike in the tax rate, this scares the hell out of everybody. What did I get the administration to do? picked up 100% of the one-time upfront cost as an incentive and a thank you for saving property tax dollars and that's exactly what we did. So, my administration is going to incentivize the hell out of it. But what I've learned the hard way because I've attempted a few of these regionalizations, consolidations, that's a home rule decision. The locals have to decide. Okay? So, it's very well that nobody may do it and it may say the same. My job in lowering property taxes have a more equitable distribution of state aid to schools. that will lower the school tax portion of your property tax bill, but also freezing property taxes for seniors once they hit 870. Now, we've got a couple of current programs that already in place and we're to keep them there. Yeah. But when there's an increase in your property tax for one year and next, you still have to pay it. I want to stop that. I want to freeze it entirely. And for first-time home buyers, let's cap it at 1% of the market value of the home for the first 5 years of home ownership so young young people can get a start. I want to talk about energy prices. You said you want to take this all of the above approach to energy. So, what is your plan for immediate relief to some of these high energy bills? Some of them are 10% higher than they were last year. First of all, my opponent has put forth an illegitimate plan that is not feasible. There are 77 incumbent Democratic legislators and not one has endorsed her plan. And you have a Democratic governor that went on TV and said, \"I don't think you can do that. Here's what I could do on day one. Pull us out of Reggie.\" The regional greenhouse gas initiative is a carbon tax policy that's costing New Jerseyians anywhere from 300 million to $500 million a year. The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is not Reggie. We shouldn't be either. It's 7 and a half years of failure. Air's no cleaner. Electricity's gone through the roof and we got to stop sending rateayer dollars to other states. That's the way that carbon tax policy works. Yeah. So, if you do that, would someone see an immediate relief in their immediate relief? There would things that would no longer appear on your monthly electricity bill. Let me say this. We also have to produce more electricity. Okay. So, what is it I'm going to do? I'm going to reopen and repurpose the six or so plants that Phil Murphy has shut down. We're going to expand our nuclear footprint in South Jersey. We're going to lift the unofficial moratorium on the current natural gas fired electricity generation plants. We're going to accelerate solar on all the rooftops of every one of those warehouses that have gone up all around the state. That's not a Nimi issue. and solar developers will tell you that the DP is not cooperative in getting the permits they need to put these solar arrays on these roofs. Those are all the things that we can do. But let me say this, there'll be no wind farms off our Jersey shore. Let me ask you about solar because I know a lot of folks used to get tax rebates and incentives to install those solar panels on their roof, businesses at the same time. Now, President Trump rolled that program back to get those incentives. So, how do you get around to still achieving your goal of more solar if you don't have the incentive to do it because it's costly? Yeah, then we'll pick up the slack here in New Jersey. But I think that's a going forward. I don't think you get cheated if you already made the decision to put the solar arrays on your roof. Uh but let's not forget whenever government gets into the job of subsidizing a whole lot of things, it kind of can distort the market at times. So let's let the free market prevail here. So you're saying you may as a on the state level give an incentive for somebody to get the solar. Listen, if you've already made that investment, your due credits, I think we have to honor the promise that was made at the time you made the investment. Going forward, let's take a look. Uh in September and October, New Jerseyians are receiving this $50 credit on their energy bill. Open up their envelopes. It's built into their bill, right? Some folks were surprised to see that. Would you continue that $50 rebate for how long? My job is to lower electricity rates and we do that by pulling out a Reggie. That's a gimmick. This is once again the Trenton Democrats taking money out of your right-hand pocket, putting a little bit back in your lefthand pocket, trying to get you to feel good about it, and they usually do it right around election time. So, no. So, you wouldn't continue it. I can get the monthly electricity bills down by pulling out a Reggie and producing more juice. And that's exactly what we're going to do. Okay. I want to talk about affordable housing. Will you as the governor of New Jersey enforce a law requiring that every town build affordable housing and how would you enforce it? Absolutely not. We'll go before the Supreme Court on day one and make an argument that I don't think they're aware of that the way we're having this statemandated highdensity housing take place in every one of our 564 towns, including those that have no mass transit, no infrastructure, no jobs, which means we're only putting more cars in the road. This policy is in violation of DP policies with regard to sustain sustainability whether it's on sewer capacity or storm water management. This is an argument that's long overdue and I'm hoping that Supreme Court will agree with me. Otherwise, I'll remind them that I get two new Supreme Court state justice appointments and one of them is the chief justice. So, yeah, it is the law. So, you're saying you would go around that? Not go around it. go before the court and make a new argument just we like we need to do on school funding that shows that what's taking place has had enormous unintended consequences. Now, we need more affordable housing in this state, seniors, disabled people, veterans, young people, but it needs to be consistent with smart growth strategies. I lived in a 52 square mile cow pasture known as Hillsboro Township and we were losing these builder remedy suits. Here's the challenge, Dan. When the state comes in and says that Town X has build needs to build 100 more affordable housing units, the developers come in and say, \"Boy, to afford the 100 units you want me to build, I got to build 400 market rate units.\" Now, the town got 500 units. Now, I just had a press conference this week in Cranberry, which is the poster child for everything that's wrong with this policy. They've got a fourth round obligation, statemandated obligation they've got to meet. They're out of open space. So, what are they doing? using eminent domain to condemn a 175year-old family farm to put up more highdensity housing. First of all, property rights are sacred in this state. Second of all, the eminent domain law was put in place to get rid of get rid of blight. We're going to condemn a farm to put up highdensity housing in a town that doesn't have jobs, mass transit or infrastructure, putting all only more idling cars on the road. It's one of the biggest hypocrisies of the Democratic party that portrays itself as being pro- environment. There's nothing sustainable about this policy. All right, let's talk about immigration. And you said on day one that you will repeal the immigrant trust directive, which currently limits local law enforcement involving uh any involvement with ICE agents. So, with that being repealed on day one, should anybody in the state illegally be deported and turned over to ICE? I've said all along that the president should do his job in securing the border. He has. And I think every governor should do their job to not encourage illegal immigration by having sanctuary sties cities and us being a sanctuary state. I also believe that that kind of policy, it does in fact restrict local law enforcement in terms of administrating certain warrants. And who am I to tell a local mayor that if he wants his police department to work in partnership with a federal agency to keep the community safe, I think that's the jurisdiction of a mayor and they should be allowed to do that. Are there any exceptions though? For for example, a person who may be here illegally, but is a contributing member of society, paying their taxes, has a job, has a family, no criminal record, should they be allowed to stay here? I've said all along that anybody came here illegally that had a history of criminality in their country of origin needs to go back. Anybody who came here illegally who's committed crime or scammed our governmental assistance programs needs to go back. Everyone else, I think, should be given a pathway to recognition. Now, if you've been here 5, 10, 15, 20 years and uh you have not been a burden to the community in any way, haven't scammed our governmental system programs, haven't engaged in criminal activity, if you're a child that was brought here under no power of your own, and you've gone through our public school system, there needs to be a pathway to recognition. Okay. Uh I want to talk about um you have ads right now going after your opponent for what you say is a flip-flop of her supporting the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, Doran Mam Donnie. But it's been well documented and you and I have talked about this that you were once critical of President Trump and have since changed positions. You told me last time that JD Vance was also critical and now he's the vice president of the United States. But the greater question is why is it okay for you to change your view as on a person but not her? Because the president had a successful first term and Joe Biden had a terrible four years and because I think the president is right when it comes to securing the border. I think it's right in trying to hit the reset button on the trade deficit so we could bring bluecollar manufacturing like jobs back to the United States. I think he's right on those issues and the Joe Biden administration I saw as a failure. Look what happened at our border. Look at the inflationary increases which by the way my opponent supported. Um so um I think that the president's much better for the country than Joe Biden was with his term. So if what we're saying is that four years from now Mandami ends up being the best mayor of all time for New York City, I guess she has a right to change her mind. Okay. You know, there's been a lot of discussion around political violence in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. You said the rhetoric and the temperature in the country need to come way down. Does that start with the president who while he was at Charlie Kirk's memorial said, \"I hate my opponents.\" Um, listen, I can't control what it is other people say. I've always tried to lead myself in a way that doesn't embarrass my parents' name or my four children. And so that doesn't mean I'm a person without passion. It doesn't mean I'm a person without conviction, but I always try to be very, very respectful with my rhetoric. What I didn't understand is that my opponent skipped two major joint appearances here in New Jersey to go to Washington DC to vote yes on the Charlie Kirk resolution celebrating his life. She had missed like 90% of the votes since she declared for governor, but had to go to Washington for that one, skipping out on two important events. voted yes on the resolution celebrating his life. I commend her. Caught hell from the far left and then issued a statement condemning him, calling him a misogynist and a racist. If that was the case, why did you vote yes on the resolution? So, I did ask her the same question. They were talking about bringing rhetoric down overall. So, what is one thing you respect about your opponent Mikey Cheryl? Despite what it is that happened to her at the Naval Academy, I hope we find out the truth. Like my army captain son, she has served our nation in the military. So, just last week, President Trump and Health Secretary RFK Jr. told pregnant women to not take Tylenol. He also said parents should not give their children Tylenol, linking both of them to autism. Now, Dr. Oz, who's a member of his administration, came out and said, \"You know what? Take it when it's appropriate.\" But you would have your own New Jersey health commissioner in a time when the president is saying that, what would you urge your health commissioner say to follow the science? I think it's really important to follow the science. I'm a big believer in the literature. Has this been documented in the literature? Have people done research? and has that research been published in some of the leading clinical journals in the country and in the world documenting uh that this is in fact true. Florida is also currently taking steps right now to eliminate childhood vaccine mandates. So on your campaign website was taking a look at it. You say you oppose a one-sizefits-all vaccination schedule. So would you explore changing the vaccination requirements for New Jersey students? changing it in this sense. There are a great many people parents who are greatly concerned about the lack of informed consent uh with regard to the vaccinations and also with regard to spreading out the vaccination schedule. It's very different today than it was when my own children were small. It's very different today from when I was small. There is a magnificent volume of vaccines that are given in a very close period of time. And so what a lot of parents are asking for is can we possibly spread out the schedule? But we have in New Jersey a medical exemption. We have in New Jersey a religious exemption and uh the party of my opponent obviously believes in those things because they've controlled the legislature for the last eight years and had the governorship for the last eight years and haven't looked to get rid of either one of those. Okay. So, so you wouldn't be able to change it because they don't want to. Uh listen, my children are vaccinated. I would suggest that people have their children vaccinated, but I also respect the fact that we do have a religious exemption in New Jersey. We do have a medical exemption in New Jersey. And I think that parents should be heard when it comes to spreading out the vaccination schedule if they want to because they're fearful of the volume that's given in such a short amount of time. Okay. I don't know if you're a soccer fan, but are you a soccer fan? Yeah. Not as big as a Yankee fan. Well, okay. But big news for New Jersey is FIFA World Cup of course coming to New Jersey. I'm a big New Jersey fan and this is a great opportunity for New Jersey and I hope we don't blow it like we did with the Super Bowl. So, let me ask you this because tickets, some of the tickets are already on sale and the specialty tickets are well into the thousands of dollars. They haven't gone on sale to the general public just yet. But would you as governor or would would you be able to talk to FIFA put aside a number of tickets? How many? And reduce the cost for New Jersey residents so they'd be able to go to a big event that's in their own backyard. The ultra commercialization of sports and that includes includes collegiate sports is of great concern to me. And what you're finding more and more is that the average Jane and Joe can't even afford to go see a game. I think that's wrong. So how would you fix it? It's a great I that's a great question and we got to figure that out. So, I know technologies are used today to sell tickets and I hear all kinds of stories of the exchanges that go on. So, we got to find out what it is we got to do to make sure the average Jane and Joe can get to a game if they want to. Understood. Giving everybody equal time here. Mr. Cherelli, great to have you. And that concludes our forum with New Jerseys gubanatorial candidates. Remember, election day is November 4th now on Arena. Have a good night.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 3 - Sherrill - NJGovernorsForum OUR ORDER TONIGHT WAS DECIDED BY RANDOM DRAW. UP FIRST IS MIKIE SHERRILL WHO HOLDS A RAZOR THIN LEAD ACCORDING TO OUR LATEST POLLING. AND AFTERWARDS, WE'LL HEAR FROM THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, JACK CIATTARELLI, WITH NEARLY 11% OF VOTERS STILL UNDECIDED. WHAT'S SAID TONIGHT COULD LEAD THOSE VOTERS TO MAKE UP THEIR MINDS. WITH ALL THAT, DAN, I HAPPENED THINGS OFF TO YOU. >> SHIRLEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH. GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE. GREAT TO HAVE OUR AUDIENCE HERE AND ALL OF YOU JOINING AT HOME AS WELL. WE DO WE BEGIN WITH THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE MIKIE SHERRILL. LET'S TALK ABOUT HER. SHE SPENT 10 YEARS IN ACTIVE DUTY FLYING NAVY FIGHTERS. SHE CURRENTLY LIVES IN MONTCLAIR, NEW JERSEY. SO PLEASE WELCOME THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR GOVERNOR, MIKIE SHERRILL.  >> ALL RIGHT. CONGRESSWOMAN. GOOD TO SEE YOU, HAVE A SEAT HERE. LOOKING FORWARD TO A GOOD CONVERSATION. WE GO A GREAT -- GOT A GREAT AUDIENCE. YOU READY TO GET STARTED? >> I'M READY. >> LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S BEEN IN THE HEADLINES ABOUT YOU. THE NEW JERSEY GLOBE PUBLISHING THIS STORY THAT YOU DID NOT WALK IN YOUR NAVAL ACADEMY GRADUATION. AS MANY REPORTS OF THIS CHEATING SCANDAL. SO I WANT TO GIVE YOU A MOMENT TO CLEAR THE AIR AND EXPLAIN WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED. >> SURE. SO I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR. I DIDN'T WALK BECAUSE I DIDN'T TURN IN SOME OF MY CLASSMATES. BUT THEN I THINK WHAT'S REALLY BEEN DISHEARTENING TO VOTERS AROUND THE STATE AND ESPECIALLY TO VETERANS IS THE FACT THAT JACK CIATTARELLI GOT ILLEGAL ACCESS TO MY PRIVATE MILITARY RECORDS. THINGS INCLUDED THINGS LIKE MYSELF SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER -- MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, INFORMATION ON MY 80-YEAR-OLD PARENTS' HOME ADDRESS, HEALTH INFORMATION. IT WAS SO OBVIOUSLY PROTECTED DATA THAT WHEN A MEMBER OF HIS CAMPAIGN TEAM GOT ACCESS TO IT, HE SAID HE WAS SHOCKED AND DISGUSTED. BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP THEM FROM SHOPPING IT TO JOURNALISTS. AND JUST TO GIVE PEOPLE A SENSE OF WHAT HAPPENED, THE DAY BEFORE THE PRIMARY, A MEMBER OF HIS TEAM ASKED FOR THE RECORDS AND WAS TOLD NO. THOSE HAD PRIVATE INFORMATION. SO THEN A COUPLE DAYS AFTER, HE WAS INTRODUCED TO, AS HE PUT IT, A REAL NICE PERSON AT THE ARCHIVES. THAT PERSON SHOULD HAVE HAD A SIGNATURE FROM ME, MY SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, AND SHOULD HAVE INFORMED THE NAVY THAT THIS HAPPENED. THEY DID NONE OF THAT AND IN FACT, SOMEONE AT THE ARCHIVES WENT INTO THE V.A. DATABASE TO PULL THE SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER, PUT IT INTO PULL DOWN MY RECORDS, AND GAVE THEM OVER ILLEGALLY. SO YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A WEEK WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN COMING UP TO ME CONSTANTLY, VETERANS, SAYING, YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA STAND UP. YOU CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN TO MY RECORDS AND MY DATA. THERE'S AN ONGOING I.G. INVESTIGATION. AND THE HOUSE ARMED LEADERS, LEADERSHIP IN THE OVERSIGHT EXT AND THE JUDICIARY HAVE ALL CALLED FOR INVESTIGATIONS INTO EXACTLY HOW THIS HAPPENED. >> AND I'M GOING TO ASK JACK ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT THE GLOBE ALSO REPORTED THAT YOU REJECTED THIS REQUEST TO RELEASE DISCIPLINARY RECORDS FROM YOUR OWN TIME IN THE ACADEMY. WAS NOT WALKING THE EXTENT OF YOUR DISCIPLINE IN THE SCANDAL? >> SO I -- HERE WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS GOTTEN ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED PRIVATE MILITARY RECORDS. RELEASED THEM. AND THEN WANTS TO GO ON SOME SORT OF RAMPAGE THROUGH ALL MY CLATS MATES' -- CLASSMATES' DATA. AND I THINK PRETTY TELLING HERE IS THAT I GRADUATED FROM THE NAVAL ACADEMY. I SERVED FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS. I WAS A HELICOPTER PILOT, A RUSSIAN POLICY OFFICER. I HELD THE HIGHEST POSITIONS OF TRUST. I HAD A TOP SECRET SECRET COMPARTMENTALIZED CLEARANCE IN THE MILITARY. AND ONCE JACK DID NOT GET WHAT HE WANTED FROM THIS, HE WENT AFTER MY HUSBAND. HE WENT AFTER OTHER MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY WHO ARE SERVING. AND SO AT THIS POINT, YEAH, I'VE BEEN VERY CLEAR. I'VE BEEN CLEAR ON WHAT HAPPENED. AND I'VE -- AND HE HAS THE RECORDS TO PROVE IT. >> AND THERE'S BEEN THESE CALLS TO RELEASE THE DISCIPLINARY RECORDS. AND ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT. IN A MATTER -- >> THESE ARE RECORDS THAT CONTAIN ALL OF MY CLASSMATES' INFORMATION. >> SO YOU'RE DISCIPLINARY RECORDS TO PUT THE ISSUE TO BED, YOU DON'T WANT TO RELEGISLATION THEM? >> LOOK -- RELEASE THEM? >> LOOK. HE HAS THE RECORDS. HE HAS THE INFORMATION. >> HE'S ASKING -- >> I'M NOT GOING TO. I'M SURE SHE'LL GO TO TRUMP NEXT. THE PROBLEM HERE IS HE'S GETTING ACCESS TO PERSONALLY IDEA FINAL INFORMATION IS NOW HIS RESPONSE IS HE WANTS TO GET MORE? I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO VOTERS, WHICH IS WHY AGAIN I'VE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE REACHING OUT. AND LOOK, I'VE SAID TO HIM. I'VE GOT STRONG SHOULDERS. I'M A SITTING MEMBER OF CONGRESS. I CAN STAND UP TO THIS. I HAVE DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE AND IF HE WANTS TO COME AT ME, I CAN TAKE THAT. BUT TO THEN GO AFTER MY FAMILY, TO OBTAIN THESE ILLEGALLY, IT'S -- YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD FOR YEARS THIS SORT OF SWIFT VOTE MENTALITY IN THE GOP WHERE YIF TIME YOU'RE A VETERAN -- ANYTIME YOU'RE A VETERAN RUNNING, THEY FIND A MEANS OF GOING AFTER YOUR RECORD OF SERVICE. AND THIS IS A NEW LOW TO ILLEGALLY GAIN ACCESS TO RECORDS AT THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES, TO NOW HAVE AN I.G. INVESTIGATION INTO JUST WHAT'S GOING ON, TO HAVE MULTIPLE LEADERS CALL TO FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, AND TO INSTEAD OF TURNING OVER THE RECORDS HE HAS ILLEGALLY, AS HE'S BEEN ASKED TO DO BY LEGAL COUNSEL, HE'S DOUBLING DOWN ON THIS. AND I THINK IT'S INAPPROPRIATE AND I THINK EVERY MEMBER OF NEW JERSEY SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES IF THIS IS WHAT HE'LL DO TO WIN AN ELECTION, WHAT WOULD HE DO AS GOVERNOR. >> WE'RE ON DAY THREE OF THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. AND LAST TIME WE SPOKE DURING THE PRIMARY, YOU HAD JUST GOTTEN BACK FROM EVENTING A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD -- PREVENTS A GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN. WHY DIDN'T YOU VOTE THIS TIME TO KEEP THE GOVERNMENT OPEN AND URGE YOUR COLLEAGUES IN -- TO DO THE SAME? WHAT WAS THE STICKING POINT TO VOTE NO. >>> SO WE HAVE SEEN WITH THE RESCISSION BILL, THE BUDGET BILL OR THE ONE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL AN TACK ON OUR ECONOMY IN NEW YORK. IT WOULD PUT -- NEW JERSEY. IT WOULD PUT A $5 BILLION HOLE IN OUR BUDGET WITH MEDICAID. THEY SAID MORE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAN IT RECEIVES BACK. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS GONE AFTER HEALTHCARE. IT WILL RAISE UTILITIES COSTS WHICH I'M DESPERATELY TRYING TO LOWER. IT WILL RAISE THE COST OF EDUCATION, AS WE'RE WORKING TO LOWER IT AND CREATE OPPORTUNITY. HE'S ATTACKING SOME OF THE INNOVATIONS THAT WE'VE PUT IN PLACE. NOW HE'S SAYING HE'S GONNA FREEZE THE GATEWAY TUNNEL MONEY. SO AGAIN AND GUN, TRYING TO ATTACK OUR ECONOMY. SO TO THEN ALLOW HIM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO, THE FIGHT IS JUST SAYING, LOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO FUND SOME OF THE HEALTHCARE -- THE COSTS ARE NOW EXORBITANT WITH WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND TRUMP IS RELUISING TO DO THAT. -- REDUCING TO -- REFUSING TO DO THAT. AND JACK IS SAYING NOTHING. WITH ALL THESE FINANCIAL HITS, JACK CIATTARELLI GOES ALONG WITH TRUMP AND THE LATEST BEING THE GATEWAY TUNNEL PROJECT WHEN HE SAID -- WHICH HE SAID WASN'T A NEW JERSEY PROBLEM. >> THE 18 BILLION DOLLARS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS WITHHOLDING FOR THIS INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT. IT'S THE TUNNEL THAT CONNECTS N AND NORTHERN. -- NORTHERN AND NEW JERSEY. HOW WOULD YOU KEEP THAT PROJECT FUNDED? >> ALMOST 100,000 JOBS IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE AND THE HIT IS HUGE. AND SO YOU KNOW, I THINK HE NEEDS -- WE NEED TO BE IN COURT RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE CONGRESS HAS APPROPRIATED THIS FUNDING TO THE GATEWAY TUNNEL. THIS IS OUR FEDERAL SHARE. AND FOR THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO ILLEGALLY WITHHOLD IT, AND THE REASON THEY'RE SAYING THEY ARE ILLEGALLY STOPPING THIS PROJECT -- THESE PROJECTS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GOING TO OTHER PROJECTS. IT'S SIMPLY THE GATE GATEWAY TUNNEL AND THE EAST SIDE SUBWAY SYSTEM. IT'S TARGETED AND I'M IN A -- GOING TO FIGHT IT. I FOUGHT IT THE FIRST TIME. >> AS GOVERNOR YOU WOULD GO TO COURT? >> I THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE IN COURT NOW AND AS GOVERNOR MY ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD TAKE THIS ADMINISTRATION TO COURT. THAT'S HOW BEV WEAN CLAWING MONEY BACK -- WE'VE BEEN CLAWING MONEY BACK. AND MY OPPONENT SAID HE'D NEVER TAKE THIS ADMINISTRATION TO COURT. >> IN A RECENT DEBATE, YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COMMIT TO NOT LOWER SALES TAX, BUT YOUR CAMPAIGN PUT OUT A STATEMENT IF YOU ARE COMMIT COMMITTED TO NOT RAISING THE SALES TAX. I WANT TO GET YOU ON THE RECORD. IS SALES TAX GOING TO GO UP DURING YOUR ADMINISTRATION? >> NO. AND WHAT JACK KEPT SAYING HE WAS PUTTING ON THE TABLE. I'VE TAKEN IT OFF THE TABLE BECAUSE I AM WORKING INCREDIBLY HARD TO LOWER COSTS FOR NEW JERSEYANS. AND AT EVERY TURN AND THROUGHOUT HISTORY, JACK HAS RAISED COSTS. SO WHILE I FOUGHT TOOTH AND NAIL TO GET RID OF THE OF THE STATE AND LOCAL TAX TAX, HE'S IMPLEMENTED. IT'S VOTED AGAINST ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN PROPERTY TAX RELIEF IS SUPPORTED TRUMP WHO NOW HAS PUT IN PLACE ANOTHER 30 BILLION-DOLLAR HIT AGAINST PROPERTY TAX RELIEF HERE. SO AGAIN AND AGAIN, I'VE WORKED TO LOWER TAXES. AND JACK AT EVERY LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT HE SERVED IN HAS VOTED TO RAISE TAXES. SO I THINK THAT TOO IS A REALLY SHARP CONTRAST. >> SO NO ON THE SALES TAX AND THERE'S THE IMPORTANT ISSUE OF A NEW JERSEY RESIDENT WHICH IS PROPERTY TAXES. I DID ASK YOU WOULD PROPERTY TAXES BE LOWER WITH YOU, YES, MEANING THEY WOULD BE LOWER. BUT YOUR RUNNING MATE SAID THAT WAS THE GOAL. SO ARE YOU CONFIDENT THAT PROPERTY TAXES WILL BE LOWER AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS IF YOU WERE GOVERNOR? >> YES. SO THAT -- YES, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO START TO MAKE CHANGES TO HOW WE ARE RUNNING OUR STATE. COSTS ARE TOO HIGH FOR PEOPLE. IT'S AT THE BREAKING POINT. I'VE HEARD FOR YEARS ABOUT PROPERTY TAXES. AND I MEAN, THAT WAS IN MY FIRST RACE. THAT WAS CONSTANTLY FOCUSED ON THE STATE AND LOCAL DEDUCTION CAP WHICH IS HOW MUCH YOU CAN DEDUCT FOR YOUR PROPERTY TAXES. I WAS HEARING FROM HOMEOWNERS ACROSS THE STATE ABOUT HOW HARD IT WAS TO CONTINUE WITH THE PROPERTY TAXES WITH THE CAP. AND NOW I'M HEARING THINGS THAT ARE MUCH WORSE ABOUT AFFORDABILITY IN OUR STATE. SO INSTEAD OF PEOPLE JUST SAYING COSTS ARE TOO HIGH, I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE, I'M DROWNING. I CAN'T KEEP MY HEAD ABOVE WATER. SOME DAYS I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T BREATHE. THIS IS A NEW LEVEL OF FAMILIES FEELING AS IF THEY JUST ARE AT THEIR WIT'S END WITH AFFORDABILITY AND PROPERTY TAXES IS ONE OF THOSE KEY AREAS. AND SO WE'VE GOT TO SHARE SERVICES. WE REALLY -- >> YES. >> AND I CAN GO INTO -- >> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEGINNING SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND A LOT A LOT OF YOUR PLAN TO DO THAT AND CONSOLIDATING THE MUNICIPALITIES. SO YOU SAID YOU WOULD LOOK AT COMPULSORY MOVEMENTS IN AREAS IF PEOPLE DIDN'T VOLUNTEER TO CONSOLIDATE. WHAT DOES THAT MOVEMENT LOOK LIKE AND HOW QUICKLY WOULD YOU TAKE ACTION IF SOMEONE DOESN'T COMBINE? >> I THINK FIRST, YOU PROVIDE THE INCENTIVE STRUF -- STRUCTURE. AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED TO DO IS ADDRESS THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS BECAUSE SOME OF OUR SCHOOLS ARE RUNNING FULL CUTS. MEANING THEIR PAYING ADMINISTRATORS. THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE BUILDINGS HOUSING THE ADMINISTRATIONS AND THEY'RE NOT RUNNING FULL CBS 12 PROGRAMS, WHICH COST -- K-12 PROGRAMS, WHICH COSTS A LOT OF MONEY. JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA, WE HAVE MORE MUNICIPALITIES THAN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE MORE SCHOOL SYSTEMS THAN MUNICIPALITIES. >> HOW WOULD YOU FORCE SOMEONE TO COMBINE? >> I THINK YOU START WITH STATE RESOURCES ON UNDERSTANDING IT, BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT SOMETIMES FOR THESE MUNICIPALITIES WHO WANT TO COMBINE SERVICES TO HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO IT. NO KNOW WHAT -- TO KNOW WHAT THE RIGHT CONTRACTING IS. SO THE STATE HAS TO PUSH THE CARROTS FIRST. WE'RE GOING TO PRI YOU OPPORTUNITIES AND DE -- PROVIDE YOU OPPORTUNITIES AND DEFRAY SOME OF THE CONCERNS TOWNS THE IT. LET'S NEGOTIATE WHERE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T MEAN BECAUSE WE'RE COMBINING ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT YOU LOSE YOUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AROUND YOUR HOUSE, WHICH PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO DO. SO YOU START THERE. AND THEN YOU ALSO INCENTIVIZE IT THROUGH RUNNING THE GREAT COUNTY-BASED SCHOOLS. SOME OF OUR COUNTY-BASED HIGH SCHOOLS ARE THE BEST PERFORMING IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW AND THEY'RE ALSO SOME OF OUR MOST NEMBLE, OFFERING STUDENTS IN STEM EDUCATION AND OCCUPATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. THAT'S THE I WOULD START. AS WE MOVE FORWARD, AS SOME OF THESE AREAS ARE BECOMING -- BECOMING MORE AND MORE EXPENSIVE TO RUN, I THINK WE HAVE TO START TO NEGOTIATE WITH HARDER ASSOCIATIONS TO STAY, LOOK, WE CAN'T KEEP FUNDING THIS AND LET'S ALL SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE TO COME TO TERMS. >> ONE OF YOUR KEY PIECES HAS BEEN THE ENERGY CRISIS THAT WE'VE BEEN FACING AND YOU SAID YOU WILL DECLARE THIS STATE OF NEW JERSEY. -- OF EMERGENCY. AND FREEZE RATES. DOES THAT MEAN RATES WILL SAY FROZEN AT THE CURRENT RATE THAN LAST YEAR? >> SO WE'RE GOING TO FREEZE THEM INITIALLY AND THEN WORK TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. >> AT THE CURRENT RATE. >> AND WORK TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. HAVE THERE HAVE BEEN TOO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND THEY PUT THAT ON THE PACK OF RATE PAYORS. SORRY WE'RE DEFRAYING THE COSTS FOR MOST VULNERABLE. NOW WE'RE FREEZING RATE HIKES FOR EVERYONE. BECAUSE THEY'RE SET TO GO UP NEXT YEAR AND WE'RE GOING TO DRIVE IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF POWER. >> SOME FOLKS WILL SAY MY ENERGY BILL IS REALLY HIGH. HOW LONG IT WILL STAY FROZEN BEFORE IT GETS LOWERED? >> WELL, RIGHT NOW THEY'RE ALL SET TO GO UP. SO THAT'S WHAT I'M COMBATING. I'M SAYING, WE CAN'T JUST KEEP SAYING EVERY YEAR BECAUSE -- >> WHEN DO PEOPLE SEE THE RELIEF? >> I THINK RIGHT AWAY AS WE MAKE SURE MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE ARE TAKEN CARE OF. AND THEN WE'RE MOVING QUICKLY. WE HAVE TO CUT THROUGH RED TAPE AND PERMITTING TO GET MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF SOLAR, PROJECT STORAGE PROJECTS. THOSE CAN GO IN RELATIVELY QUICKLY AND THE FASTER WE CAN MOVE THEM AND THE BETTER BECAUSE WE STILL COULD GET SOME ACCESS TO THE FEDERAL GRANT MONEY TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. SOME OF THE GAS GENERATION PLANTS WE CAN MODERNIZE THEM WITHIN THREE TO FIVE YEARS. AND THEN THERE'S SOME LONGER LONG-FIXES LIKE NUCLEAR POWER. BUT EVERY BIT OF POWER THAT WE PRODUCE IN THE STATE RIGHT NOW IS DRIVING DOWN COSTS SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE THE MARKET IS SO SCREWED UP BY PJM THAT BUYING ON THE MARKET NOW IS QUITE EXPENSIVE. SO EVERY ELECTRONIC WE START TO PRODUCE STARTS TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS FOR EVERYONE. >> OUR NEXT QUESTION. JENNIFER, TAKE A LISTEN HERE. >> NEW JERSEY'S PLAN TO BAN THE SALE OF NEW GAS-POWERED CARS STARTING IN 2035 IS IN LIMBO DUE TO RESOLUTIONS SIGNED BY TROUPE. THAT -- POUP. MURPHY SAID IT WOULD LEAD TO CLEANER AIR AND MIT TATE CLIMB IMPLANTS. WOULD YOU FIND -- MITIGATE IMPLANTS. WOULD YOU FIGHT -- >> I'VE BEEN FOCUSED HOW WE'RE DRIVING DOWN CARBON AND I'VE SAID TO PEOPLE, I'M AGNOSTIC HOW WE DO IT. WE NEED MORE POWER, CHEAPER POWER, AND CLEANER POWER. AND ONE OF THE GREATEST SOURCES ARE OUR CARS. SO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE MOVING PEOPLE INTO CARS THAT BURN CLEANER IS A HUGE GOAL OF MINE. NOW, WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE FACT THAT WE DON'TOLOGIST HAVE ALL THE CHARGING STATIONS WE NEED -- DON'T ALWAYS HAVE THE CHARGING STATIONS WE NEED. I'VE BEEN A SUPPORTER OF HYBRID CARS, WHICH IS KIND OF A GATEWAY INTO PEOPLE BECOMING COMFORTABLE IN DRIVING DOWN THEIR FUEL EMISSIONS. SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SEE WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS AND CERTAINLY TAKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO COURT IN EVERY WAY BECAUSE I WANT AUTONOMY AS GOVERNOR IN NEW JERSEY. I I THINK WE'LL HAVE THE SEE -- TO SEE. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE READY FOR THIS RIGHT NOW. >> WE TALKED ABOUT THE GATEWAY TUNNEL PROJECT. NEW JERSEY TRANSIT AS WELL AS THE TOLLS ARE GIVING THESE ANNUAL 3% FARE HIKES. WOULD YOU SAY NO MORE? >> I WANT TO COME UP WITH A DEDICATED SOURCE FOR FUNDING -- FUNDING FOR RAIL. RAIL IS NOT FUNDED ON THE BACKS OF COMMUTERS. IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. >> YEAH. >> SO GENERALLY AROUND THE WORLDED YOU LOOK AT THINGS LIKE TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT, THE -- THE REAL ESTATE THAT OUR RAIL HAS TO DO THINGS LIKE RUN PARKING LOTS THAT GET MONEY INTO THE SYSTEM. AND ADVERTISING ON BUSES, RAIL SYSTEMS, ET CETERA. ALL OF THIS FEEDS IN MONEY SO YOU HAVE A DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING AND CAN KEEP COSTS LOWER. >> SO NO FARE HIKES? >> I'M NOT SURE HOW QUICKLY WE CAN GET SOME OF THIS DONE. AND WHEN THAT WILL START. BUT I WANT TO GET A DEDICATED SOURCE IN IN SO WE CAN LEVEL OFF. >> I WANT TO TALK ABOUT RIGHT NOW A REALLY IMPORTANT TOPIC, WHICH IS IMMIGRATION. AND LAST TIME I SAT WITH YOU, I ASKED YOU IF YOU THOUGHT NEW JERSEY SHOULD BE A SINK UWE'RE STATE AND -- SANCTUARY STATE. GOVERNOR MURPHY STARLGTED THE IMMIGRANT TRUST DIRECTIVE. I ASKED YOU LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR THIS -- AT OUR DEBATE IN YOUR ADMINISTRATION WOULD KEEP THAT. TAKE A LISTEN TO WHAT HE HAD TO SAY. >> WELL, MIKIE IS GOING TO HIRE AN ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT'S VERY STRONG THAT MAY HAVE SOMETHING STRONGER THAN THAT. >> SOMETHING EVEN STRONGER THAN THE IMMIGRANT TRUST DIRECTIVE. WOULD YOU CONTINUE THAT? >> SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS FOR COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM. THAT'S AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE GOTTEN VERY CLOSE TO ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE LAST TIME -- THE LAST TIME PRESIDENT TRUMP TOOK IT DOWN DESPITE THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN SOME OF THOSE CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE THAT WE THOUGHT WAS VERY CLOSE. AND WE THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO GET IT DONE, BUT HE TOOK IT DOWN FOR POLITICAL REASONS. AND THAT WOULD HAVE STRENGTHENED OUR BORDERS AND PROVIDED A PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE HERE AND PAYING TAXES AND DACA -- TACKA RECEPTESTS. THAT'S -- RECIPIENTS. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT WAS A GOOD PATHWAY. WHERE WE HAVE NOW IS MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC SAFETY. AND THAT OUR STREETS ARE SAFE. AND SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS ENSURING THAT PEOPLE CAN GO REPORT CRIMES WITH THE POLICE, THAT THEY CAN GO TO SCHOOL, THAT THEY CAN GO TO CHURCH AND FEEL SAFE AND FEEL SAFE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. AND THAT'S WHY ALSO I'M ON LEGISLATION FEDERALLY AND WILL PUT IN AND GET LEGISLATION IN THIS STATE TO MAKE SURE FEDERAL AGENTS ARE IDENTIFIABLE. >> YEAH. YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MASK. THE QUESTION IS REALLY, THE IMMIGRANT TRUST DIRECTIVE. YOU'VE BEEN VAGUE ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU WOULD KEEP IT. IS IT A YES OR NO? WILL YOU KEEP THAT DIRECTIVE? >> WELL, I THINK I'VE BEEN CLEAR ON THE AREAS I'M VERY IN FAVOR OF. MAKING SURE PEOPLE CAN GO TO REPORT CRIMES WITH THE POLICE OR SAFELY GO GET HEALTHCARE. >> DO YOU FEEL THEY CAN DO THAT WITH THE DIRECTIVE? >> I THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER AREAS THAT I THINK ARE UNCLEAR. SO I THINK YOU KNOW, JUST SPEAKING TO SOMEONE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT EARLIER ABOUT CONCERNS ABOUT, WELL, WHAT IF SOMEONE IS IN REAL DANGER, WHAT IF A FEDERAL AGENT IS IN REAL DANGER AND THEY NEED TO HELP THEM. SO THERE ARE SOME AREAS THAT AREN'T CLIERP ENOUGH. >> SO DO YOU WANT TO GET RID OF IT? >> THERE ARE AREAS OF OF IT THAT I'M SUPPORTED OF AND OTHERS NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. >> SHOULD LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT PLAY ANY ROLE IN THE ICE RAIDS AROUND THE COUNTRY. SOME SHOULD LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT DO WHAT? >> PLAY ANY ROLE IN SOME OF THESE I.C.E. RAIDS THAT WE'RE SEEING PLAY OUT AROUND THE COUNTRY. >> I THINK THE JOB OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT IS KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFE. AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN SO CONCERNED ABOUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE COMING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES THAT ARE UNIDENTIFIABLE. SO I HEARD FROM ONE MEMBER OF LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO IS SPEAKING TO A FRIEND OF MINE WHO SAID, A GUY CAME INTO HIS TOWN LOOKING LIKE HE WAS GOING TO AFGHANISTAN. WAS THE QUOTE. AND WHEN THE POLICE OFFICER FROM THE TOWN ASKED HIM FOR YID FIGS, HE -- IDENTIFICATION, HE SAID HE DIDN'T HAVE TO PROVIDE ANY. AND WHEN PUSHED AND THE POLICE OFFICER SAID YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME OR, YOU KNOW, I'M GOING TO ARREST YOU, HAD YOU SAID I'M GONNA ARREST YOU AND THE TWO OF THEM WE'LL WORK IT OUT IN PRISON. AND HE FINALLY SHOWED SOME I.D. BUT TO HAVE PEOPLE FULLY ARMED REFUSING TO IDENTIFY THEMSELVES IS NOT SAFE. AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I THINK OUR POLICE ARE HAPPY WITH. I THINK THERE ARE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE. SO AGAIN, WE'VE HEARD ABOUT ICE AGENTS REPELLING INTO APARTMENT BUILDINGS, FROM HELICOPTERS, WE'VE HEARD ABOUT PEOPLE BEING PICKED UP WHO ARE HERE ILLEGAL -- LEGALLY AND DETAINED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND PEOPLE CAN'T FIND THEM. THAT KIND OF THING. AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU KNOW, I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR POLICE OFFICERS ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION. >> OKAY. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR WHICH CLEARLY HAS TO WORK WITH PARTNERS IN THE AREA. FOCUS WOULD BE NEW YORK CITY. YOUR OPPONENT HAS PUT OUT VARIOUS ADS CLAIMING YOUR FLIP -- YOU'RE FLIP-FLOPPING ON NEW YORK MAYOR FOR SUPPORT. DO YOU SUPPORT THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE? >> I HAVE NOT GETTING ENGAGED IN THAT RACE BECAUSE I'M COMPLETELY FOCUSED ON NEW JERSEY. I'M GOING TO LET THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK DECIDE THAT RACE. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS LAST TIME WE SPOKE, BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS ASK ME ABOUT HIM AND I'M NOT GETTING ASKED ABOUT THAT ON THE STREETS OF NEW JERSEY. PEOPLE IN NEW JERSEY ARE CONSTANTLY TALKING TO ME ABOUT AFFORDABILITY. THEY'RE TALKING TO ME ABOUT THEIR COSTS, ABOUT ELECTRICITY, ABOUT HOUSING PRICES, ET CETERA, ABOUT HEALTHCARE. THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THE FREEZING OF GATEWAY TUNNEL FUNDS. >> THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING IS BECAUSE IT IS BECOMING A NATIONAL RACE MUCH LIKE THIS ONE, RIGHT. SO WHY NOT SUPPORT A FELLOW DEMOCRAT IN A RACE? >> AGAIN, I'M FOCUSED ON THE NEW JERSEY RACE AND THAT'S A NEW YORK RACE. I'M NOT REGISTERED TO VOTE THERE SO I'M FOCUSED HERE. >> OUR MOST RECENT POLLING SHOWED OUR NEXT IMRCH -- THEY WANT HIM TO STAND UP TO THE PRESIDENT. IS THERE SOMETHING THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING RIGHT NOW THAT YOU THINK IS A POSITIVE FOR NEW JERSEY AND YOU'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HIM AND BUILD UPON? >> I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE PRESIDENT AT SOME POINT SOON DECIDES TO RE-OPEN THE GOVERNMENT AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH HIM ON PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR HEALTHCARE AND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. SO SUBSIDIES DON'T UP -- GO UP HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS ACROSS THE STATE. >> WHAT IS ONE THING YOU RESPECT ABOUT YOUR OPPONENT? >> ONE OF HIS CHILDREN IS IN THE MILITARY. AND I RESPECT SERVICE. >> JUST LAST WEEK PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE HEALTH SECRETARY TOLD PREGNANT WOMEN TO NOT TAKE TYLENOL. HE SAID THAT PARENTS SHOULD NOT GIVE THEIR CHILDREN TYLENOL, LINKING BOTH OF THEM TO AUTISM. DR. OZ CAME OUT AND SAID TAKE IT WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE. BUT YOU BUT YOU WOULD HAVE YOUR OWN HEALTH COMMISSIONER IN NEW JERSEY. WHAT WOULD YOU ADVISE YOUR RESIDENTS? >> I I WOULD URGE MY HEALTH COMMISSIONER TO REVIEW THE DATA, COME OUT WITH THEIR FINDINGS AND URGE PEOPLE TO FOLLOW THOSE FINDINGS. >> WE'RE ALSO HEADING INTO DARE I SAY PEAK UPPER RESPIRATORY ILL NRLTS SEASON. THE -- ILLNESS SEASON. THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION IS ISSUING THE ORDER TO NOT -- WOULD YOU CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM AND HOW LONG WOULD YOU CONTINUE IT FOR? >> I WOULD CONTINUE THAT PROGRAM. THERE ARE CERTAIN VULNERABLE PEOPLE THAT NEED ACCESS TO THESE VACCINES AND I'M ALSO REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS ROLLBACK AND SOME BASIC PROTECTIONS. SO FOR ALMOST 50 YEARS, CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE MMR VACCINE, MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBELLA. CHILDREN HAVE BEEN GIVEN VACCINES FOR PUR SUSES. SOME OF THESE DISEASES HAVE BEEN ALL BUT ERADICATED AND NOW THERE ARE UNVACCINATED POPPATIONS -- POPULATIONS AND IT DOESN'T TAKE TOO MUCH OF A PERCENTAGE TO DROP FOR IMMUNITY TO BE LOST. WE'VE 10 ABOUT 10 DAYS OF -- CASES OF MEASLES IN NEW JERSEY. AND WE'RE THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED STATE IN THE NATION. AND WE'VE SEEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY SEVERAL BABIES DYING FROM PERTUSSIS OR WHOOPING COUGH. AND REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO WAIT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME TO GET THAT VACCINE. SO THE IDEA THAT YOU ARE GONNA HAVE YOUR CHILD GO TO SCHOOL AND BE THREATENED WITH DISEASES THAT SHOULD BE ERADICATED, THAT I'VE NEVER SEEN A CASE OF MEASLES OR MUMPS OR RUBELLA. THESE WERE DISEASES THAT IN MY CHILDHOOD HAD BEEN PRETTY MUCH ERADICATED TO THINK THAT YOU'D SEND YOUR CHILD -- I HAVE FOUR KIDS. SO AS I WAS SENDING KIDS TO SCHOOL, I HAD BABIES AT HOME OFTEN AND PUT EVERYONE IN LEARNG DAMAGER. I LIVED WITH MY IN-LAWS, PUTTING THEM IN DANGER. AS GOVERNOR I'M GOING TO WORK WITH THE NORTHEAST HEALTH CONTORTION -- CONSORTIUM WHICH EMERGENCY IS A PART OF TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PUTTING OUT GOOD MEDICAL DATA AND WE'RE ALSO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO REGULAR VACCINES. >> UP AGAINST THE CLOCK HERE. YOUR OPPONENT IS RUNNING AD SAYING A VOTE FOR YOU IS A VOTE FOR MILL FEWER FEE -- PHIL MURPHY. WHAT'S A LETTER GREAT YOU WOULD GIVE HIM? >> I THINK ABOUT A B. HE -- HE CERTAINLY HAS PAID INTO THE PENSION. HE'S HAD THE CREDIT RATING INCREASE NINE TIME. WHICH IS GREAT. BUT I'M ALSO REALLY FRUSTRATED. I THINK THERE'S A CULTURE IN TRENTON IN A NEED TO HAVE A CULTURE SHIFT, A GET TO KNOW CULTURE THAT WORK WITH THE CITIZENS OF NEW JERSEY CULTURE. I'M FRUSTRATED WHERE WE ARE ON ELECTRICITY COSTS. AND THAT THE RED TAPE AND BUREAUCRACY HAS NOT BEEN APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED. AND SO WE'RE NOT GETTING NEW PROJECTS INTO THE GROUND TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS FOR PEOPLE. >> OKAY. WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT THERE. GIVING EQUAL TIME",

This is a series of two programs where we interview both candidates for governor New Jersey, the major party candidates. Uh New Jersey's next governor. Who will it be? We kick off the series with Jack Chidarelli, a former state legislator, a business professional, the Republican candidate for governor. Jack, good to see you. Steve, great to be with you. Thanks for having me on. You got Hey, before we talk issues, let's do this real quick. 30 seconds on your family history in New Jersey. We've been here for 100 years. My grandparents came from Volantano, Italy, which is just northwest of Rome. And um you know, it's typical Italian New Jersey family, but three generations of us have achieved our American dream right here. And I want to make sure future generations of New Jerseyians do, too. Let's talk about that. Harder and harder for folks to stay in the state, particularly younger people. Affordability is talked about all the time, but let's get down to details. The most significant thing you would do as governor, if elected in January 2026 regarding affordability in the state, would be we need to build more affordable housing, but we're going to be very smart about where we put it. We're overdeveloping our suburban communities where there's no mass transit, no infrastructure, no jobs, only putting more idling cars on the road. The opposition party's taking garden right out of the Garden State. I want to use affordable housing as a way to get people want to live in our major urban centers again like Norark, like Trenton, like Atlantic City. For young people, I also want to make the first two years out of high school or college taxfree. No income tax in your first two years. For seniors, all retirement income should be taxfree, just like it is in Pennsylvania, and your property taxes are frozen for life once you hit age 70. Jack, how would you make up that budget shortfall without that revenue coming in? Steve, it took us 238 years to get to 36 billion. In 8 years, we've gone from 36 billion to 59 billion. I believe we're bloated. I believe we're inefficient. There's room in our government to do these very fiscally responsible programs that are long overdue. We cannot continue with this affordability crisis. Jack, you talk a lot about Governor Murphy. He's not the candidate. Congresswoman Cheryl is, who we'll do a an in-depth half hour interview with. What is your biggest beef with Governor Murphy's policies and how does that relate to Congresswoman Cheryl? He's not the candidate, but his policies are on the ballot. This is a referendum on Phil Murphy's policies which she has supported. Take a look at your monthly electric bill. Everywhere I go around this state, everybody is talking about their monthly electric bill. They broke it. They own it. Steve, when Murphy took office, we were an electricity exporter. Today we have to import it through the exchanges because he shut down six different electricity generation plants. Didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey. Didn't accelerate solar on the rooftops of all the warehouses that have gone up which are ripe for solar arrays and bet it all on wind. And here we are today importing it and paying through the nose. It's interesting. Um Jack, you talk about the governor, Governor Murphy not being on the ballot. President Trump Trump is not on the ballot either, but he matters. We agree that he is and his policies are particularly federal policies impacting New Jersey. They are relevant. Fair. Uh here's how he matters. He's put a temporary halt on wind farms off the Jersey shore. That agrees with an overwhelming number of New Jerseyians. I support that. I'll make it permanent. He's beating up on the New York Democrats over their congestion pricing plan. I think it's an egregious money grab to ask New Jerseyians to pay for their subway system. He just signed a budget bill that quadruples the property tax deduction salt on your federal tax return. Doubles the child care tax credit. State and local taxes. Sorry for interrupting, Jack. The state and local taxes. What's happening there? Was a $10,000 cap. What's it now? 40,000. And in that bill, he also doubled the child care tax credit for families with young children. Doesn't tax tips, social social security, or overtime. And provides a magnificent tax credit for people who send their kids to private school. But your governor has to opt in. Vocal and Newsome have already said they won't. Cheryl won't say anything about it. We're opting in to get people that tax credit. You know, Jack, you just listed a whole range of things um that you believe President Trump is doing that benefits the state. Let's look at the other side or some would argue the other side of the coin um in the so-called big beautiful bill passed by Congress, proposed by the president, federal cuts, significant federal cuts to Medicaid. It is estimated by several credible sources, including the New Jersey Department of Human Services, that 350,000 eligible residents for Medicaid will potentially lose their healthc care coverage because of the barriers that are set up in the federal legislation that takes many people off of Medicaid who will no longer qualify. Almost 400,000 New Jerseyians. Jack, first, you agree that that will happen. Second, if it does, how's that a good thing? You know, Steve, the key word you use there is potentially affect 350,000 New Jerseyians. This reminds me very much of when Bill Clinton turned welfare into workfare, and we heard the same kind of rhetoric. Here's what the president has done. He's making you now verify twice a year that you're eligible for your Medicaid. That was originally put in place by Barack Obama. Trump kept it in place. Joe Biden put it to once a year. I think it's reasonable for you to have to verify twice a year. Here's the other thing that bill does. If you're on Medicaid and you're able-bodied and your children are 15 or older, you have to give us 20 hours a week of work, volunteerism, or education in order to continue to qualify. I think those are reasonable, and I don't think you're going to see 350,000 people potentially affected by these changes. Okay? Federal policies in the Trump administration regarding immigration, let's be clear on this. Um, we have a whole range of law enforcement professionals joining us. We're taping all day today and some of them are saying, \"Look, we are in control of law enforcement in our community, a local community, a municipality, an urban community, a county, whatever, and the state of New Jersey.\" You have said the sanctuary state, I don't even know if that's an official thing, um, Jack, but you're saying sanctuary state no more. Correct. Correct. The immigrant trust directive goes away on day one, executive order number one. Okay. But the federal government sending National Guard troops into or ICE folks, folks from ICE, federal government folks into a municipality or a county that says, \"Wait a minute, we'll handle law enforcement.\" Does that make sense to you? A and B, couldn't it? And may it create real confusion regarding who's in control of law enforcement? The first job of any public official, Steve, and you've been one, is public safety. And if the current leadership is not protecting the citizenry, the president has an obligation, I think, to do that. But here's the deal. He won't ever have to worry about doing that. New Jersey, I'll pick an attorney general and I'll appoint 21 county prosecutors that will support our local police. We should not be restricting them in any way. Keep our community safe. Okay. Um, shift gears. I've talked to you before. I've talked to many people. We've had an ongoing series that really looks at talks about affordability. Um, former Assemblyman Sharelli talked about affordability. Congresswoman Sher will as well. Affordability also has to do with child care. Long-standing series on child care. The graphic will come up. It's a new initiative called Start Strong NJ. It has to do with affordable quality accessible child care. Um, federal money matters, state money matters. You're governor. top priority regarding child care would be providing a voucher for those among certain income levels to take that voucher and use it to offset the cost of child care expenses which is usually the second or third biggest expense in any family budget. Uh it's breaking middle class and lower middle class families. So again, the president's budget bill doubles the child care tax credit. I'll provide a voucher system to allow people to go to the child care facility of their choice and wherever you are on the income level, it will help offset that cost. Jack, do you have a sense of where that cap is a in terms of income and b what the voucher would be? We'll sit down and do that demographic profile and analysis, Steve, but that's what I'm committed to doing. Again, this is one of the biggest expenses uh across New Jersey for families with young children. Okay. I'm going to go back to issues, particularly New Jersey Transit and some other things in a second. This is the third time you run for governor. Um, I saw you in a recent interview talking about how much you've learned running for governor. In these incredibly challenging times, in these polarized times, in the last two times you ran, political violence was not what it is today. It's always been there, but never heightened to the degree that it's been. We are taping this literally a week or so after uh the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk, one of many. um instances of political violence. Jack, as governor, what could and would you do to tamp down political violence in this state? You know, the way you go about your business, Steve, as a candidate means an awful lot. This campaign is marked by positive energy, a message that unites, doesn't divide, and a message that's really about people, not power or politics. And so, it's my job to get up and down the state. Last weekend, we were in different houses of worship, including all black congregations in two different houses of worship in Essex County. The power of social media is people seeing where it is I go. And as a Republican, I've always gone places other Republicans don't or won't. That's how you bring people together. So, specific to your question, I will reinvigorate the interfaith council. We'll bring together the leaders of every faith in Jersey every month over breakfast with the governor to talk about how we work in partnership to strengthen our community. And I've committed myself to attending two different houses of worship each month and using social media to show people where it is I'm going. Let's embrace our diversity. There's power and beauty in our diversity here in New Jersey if we embrace it. And diversity of thought. Absolutely. Respecting each other. To listen. To listen is to acknowledge the dignity of the other person. Jack, you are not President Trump. You are your own person, but so far in the interview, you've basically praised everything he's done as president as it relates to New Jersey. But these quotes right after the Charlie Kirk assassination, I want to ask you to respond. He said this on Fox News. I'm reading for the New York Times. I'll tell you something that's going to get me in trouble, but I couldn't care less. The radicals on the right often times are radicals because they don't want to see crime. January 6th is what it is. People can decide for themselves. That's not the president. That's me saying that. The president continues, \"The radicals on the left, they are the problem and they're vicious and they're horrible and they're politically savvy.\" Jack, you just talked about coming together, listening to people, respecting all sides. the president. This is after the assassination of a leading member of the Minnesota legislature. You were in the legislature in New Jersey. I was in the legislature. That female legislator, her husband, killed in the middle of the night. President was asked about it. He said, \"Who you talking about?\" Translation, is the president's rhetoric helping, Jack? Steve, I I can't control what other people say. All I can do is lead. And so I've seen some pretty ugly ugly uh comments from people across the political spectrum. Agreed. Uh there's hate on the left, there's hate on the right. The key is for our leaders to call out hate when they see it. I will tell you on my recent uh return uh from my trip to Israel as a gubernatorial candidate, some of the rhetoric, some of the comments I saw on social media were ugly. I can't believe that's my fellow New Jerseyians or my fellow Americans. Emotions are running high right now across the spectrum. And when people get this emotional, they tend to say things maybe they shouldn't say. My job is to lead. Before we take this break, one more thing. I want to be clear. You do not believe that there's some disproportionate effort and and political violence that is coming from the left versus the right as opposed to political violence is an issue across the board. I'm not going to speak for you, Jack, but clarify. You don't believe it's one side more than the other because I don't know where that gets us. Uh there's hate all around, Steve. What we should be most concerned with is this was a 22year-old young man that had his entire life ahead of him. What would ever compelled somebody that age to do something this terrible and this heartbreaking? Agreed. Let us not and this is not what aboutism but I'll just say this and again my job is not to editorialize and I won't but when Paul Pelosi the husband of the former speaker of the house was attacked in the middle of the night um with a hammer and almost lost his life. Let's just say there are a lot of folks online who have a political point of view consistent with some folks on the right who found it funny. Nothing funny about that and nothing funny about what happened at Charlie Kirk. We're talking to Jack Chidurelli, Republican candidate for governor. We'll have a half hour with his Democratic opponent, uh, Mikey Sher. It'll be just as civil, just with different points of view. We'll come right back right after this. To see more State of Affairs with Steve Abato programs, find us online and follow us on social media. Steve Aottabato, way more importantly, Jack Chidarelli, potentially uh the next governor of New Jersey. It could be Mikey Cheryl as well. Jack, let me ask you this. Uh, public health. We're very into public awareness. Those of us in public media, trying to explain to folks what the truth is, what the science is about public health. Vaccine vaccine policy in Florida. D. Santis, the governor. No more mandates. Your governor January 2026 mandates for vaccines. Uh, I believe in in childhood vaccines, Steve. My children are vaccinated. They would be again. I think it's very very concerning that we're seeing outbreaks of measles, mumps, rebella uh across the the country. And so again, one of the top priorities of any elected official is public health. And so what I do believe in a dialogue with the medical profession is a great many people have concerns about the concentrations of vaccines in a very short amount of time. And so in discussions with medical professionals, they seem okay with spreading out the vaccination schedule. And I don't think people should have to pay more out of pocket because health insurance companies don't want to pay for a spread out vaccine schedule. But along those lines, RFK Jr. as we speak is the head of health policy in this country has said consistently, we need to find out more about whether vaccines cause autism. The studies have been done. Jack, you you're not a scientist and neither am I, but those studies have been done. Is the debate and the constant questioning as to whether the MMR vaccine causes autism the kind of thing we should be discussing? As governor, would you say that every child should be vaccinated for measles, MS rebella? I believe that every child should be vaccinated for those potential disease states. And uh listen, if the federal government is going to do anything right now, let's have the most exhaustive research of all time uh to answer the question as to whether or not vaccines cause autism. Um we do know there is vaccine injury. We do know that. I mean, you you hear the old story today from doctors that if aspirin had to go through the FDA process today, it wouldn't get approved. Uh all medications have the risk. Look what we've learned from the COVID vaccine. And I'm someone who took the vaccine, so let's do the exhaustive research to come to a conclusion. I'm sorry for interrupting, Jack, but that vaccine saved millions of lives. And there are many who argue that President Trump, who was president at the time, when Operation Warp Speed was underway and the vaccine, it was amazing what happened. It was praised. The president praised it, others praised him for it. Now questioning it, how much sense does that make? You can't have it both ways. Wait a second. those who argue that yeah if something shows up 2 3 4 years after you took it that would strongly suggest that maybe it wasn't as safe as we thought there has been injury from the co vaccination but then again the same thing happens when people take the flu vaccine each year so but let me say this uh as new as the vaccine was for the co virus I don't think people should have been forced to take it and I don't think people should have lost their jobs over it you don't I don't think people force to me the COVID vaccine was no different than the flu vaccine. We don't force people to get the flu vaccine. But don't you put Jack, I don't want to turn this into a public health discussion in great depth because there's so many other issues. We're going to talk about New Jersey Transit after this and those who are on those trains suffer every day. That being said, Jack, um, but those who are vulnerable, not those who choose not to get the vaccine, but those who are at risk, don't we put others at risk who are older, who are younger, who have immune systems that are compromised? Don't we put them at risk by saying you don't have to get it? Are you required by law to get the flu vaccine, which causes thousands of deaths each year amongst our most vulnerable people in the community? So, you're saying not mandated? Uh, I don't see it as any different than the flu vaccine. Okay. Um, New Jersey Transit, Governor Murphy, and I remember it wasn't in the interview he did with me, but he did it many years ago. If he doesn't, you know, the quote, I'm going to I'm going to fix New Jersey unless if it kills me. He'll be leaving office in January 2026. We wish him a long healthy life with his family. It's not fixed. Not even close. top priority for you, New Jersey Transit, as governor, please. Number one, I'm going to reorganize our state government in a number of different ways, Steve. We'll have a Department of Commerce. We'll have a Department of Energy. And what I hope to have is the Garden State Transportation Authority. Other states do it this way. Let's put all of our mass transit systems under one roof. And that includes the Atlantic City Expressway, which produces revenue with its tolls. Turnpike and Parkway, which produces revenue with its tolls, New Jersey Transit, which produces revenues with its fairs. I want one management structure. I got authorities everywhere running these different mass transit systems. I think from an accountability standpoint, from a transparency standpoint, from a management standpoint, we put it all under one roof. And let me say this specific to New Jersey Transit. We're a sprawl state. We can't possibly be everywhere. We have to re-evaluate every single train and bus line to make sure it's getting the kind of readership that says we should continue with those lines. um so that we can dedicate our resources to the lines that are most most used by commuters. So let me let let me do this. We actually put out on Facebook um X uh Instagram other places. We ask people we said look we have Jack Chidarelli we have Mikey Cheryl what's the number one question you would ask them and sometimes social media is really useful in engaging people. You know that sometimes sometimes and in this case it was true the the questions we got were extraordinary. I want to thank everyone who took the time to to to write in questions, but many of the questions, Jack, were about state funding of our public schools. What is the most significant change that you would make? And this is tough because you get into the state funding formula and it's arcane government mumbo jumbo jargon acronyms nobody understands. explain it in a way that folks will understand what is the what's the biggest change you would make to the state funding formula, state monies going to our public schools, which has a great impact on property taxes. Jack, the state's taking over the cost of special ed in every one of our 600 districts. It's causing a crowding out effect in the local budget, and we should not have disparity in the quality of special ed from one district to the next. States's taking over the cost of special ed. After that, every district gets X for every English- speakaking student, Y for every English language learner because that student is a bit more educationally intensive. And then every district better be within a reasonable range on a cost per pupil basis for non-special ed. And if they're not, they're wasting state tax dollars. And I'll reduce their uh their state aid dollar for dollar. Real quick on this, you you've been critical of some urban communities that you believe are getting too much state aid and not spending it. Well, fair to say I've been critical of those that get the greatest amount of state aid that have terrible educational outcomes. 80% of the kids in Newark are not on grade level for reading, writing, math. But I blame that as much on the current administration who in the post-pandemic world has not put in place after school programs, summer enrichment programs, or put in place a high impact curriculum. We slipped from 2 to 12 on the National Report Card. Louisiana went from 48 to 32 with a high impact curriculum. That's what we need in New Jersey. Real quick, Jack, I'm gonna I'm gonna go last question on President Trump. I think Jack, you've been asked a hundred times about this. Just clarify. Back in 2015, you said the president wasn't qualified to be president. You just did. And it wasn't about policy and it wasn't about politics. It was about character. What the heck changed in 10 years? JD Vance and Marco Rubio said a whole lot worse than I did, Steve. And today they're leading our nation. One as vice president, the other one as Secretary of State. What changed is his performance in the first term. And I think that he matured as a politician. And uh I think we're seeing a stark difference from Joe Biden's four years. We needed change. We needed to secure the border. He did that. And we needed to hit the reset button on the trade deficit. And that's what he's trying to do. Since you mentioned uh trade deficit, what if any concerns you have about the long-term impact of tariffs particularly on small business? You're a small business professional, three generations of uh family in business. You have an accounting background if I'm not mistaken. CPA. Yes. I was never good with numbers. Thank god others are. That being said, Jack, any concerns if at all about tariffs because a lot of business people D's and Rs are saying we're worried for the future tariffs. Uh the president was very transparent, Steve, that there may be some shortterm pain for the long-term gain. The way to get interest rates down for the long term is by correcting the trade deficit. We've got to bring manufacturing jobs back home. President Obama was a globalist and that global philosophy and approach to economics caused a lot of offshoring. When middle class New Jerseyians and across America are losing their job because Whirlpool is manufacturing its appliances in the Pacific Rim, how is that good for America? We got to fix the trade deficit. There might be some short-term pain. And if there is, I'll do my best to make up for it with our New Jersey economy with my policies. Got a minute and a half left. Biggest concern you have about Mikey Cheryl and I ask you to say something nice about her. So, please get ready to do that. Uh, number one, she's not from New Jersey, and I don't think she understands New Jersey. My number two, she's not getting up and down this state. I don't think she's been south of 195. The other thing is, if you're going to interview for this job, do your homework. I haven't seen that in her interviews. Number four, Jack, hold on. Not come being from New Jersey is a bad thing. I mean, those of us born and raised here, we love the state, those who can afford to stay here. But that's really in and of itself, that's an issue. Jack, let me show you how it's an issue. If you're from New Jersey, you'd realize how sank sank our Jersey shore is. Steve, nobody wants those wind farms off our Jersey shore. Male, female, Republican, Democrat, liberal, conservative, for different reasons, and it's bad energy policy. So, stop forcing that down our throats. There's another way to meet our energy need. All right, 30 seconds. Something positive about your Democratic opponent, not your enemy, just your opponent in this campaign. Mikey Cheryl. Uh like my army captain's son, Steve, we salute her service to our nation. Jack Chidarelli, the Republican candidate for governor in the great state of New Jersey.

    "transcript_text": "Oct 6 - Ciattarelli - Nutleytownhall I know you said Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Just a heads up. >> Oh, wow. Heat. Heat. Don't use I think we might have met before. >> I did. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I saw it right next to Heat. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Yeah. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat.   I love you. >> Good evening everybody. Uh, I have a 15-minute speech because nobody really wants to listen to this guy. I'm Al Barus. I'm the chairman of the Republican party. It is my pleasure and honor to introduce to you the next governor of the state of New Jersey. Those  people outside protesting, how disappointed are they going to be in 28 days? >> Cuz I'm here to tell you right here, right now, in 28 days, we're declaring victory. We're winning this race. >> There are great signs everywhere across the state of New Jersey that we're winning this race. Number one, we're out fundraising my opponent. How about that one? >> Wow. >> Number two, we've got Democratic elected officials up and down this state that are endorsing Mike Hennessy. Yesterday was no less than five in North Bergen and Hudson County. >> Another sign is the desperation on the other side. They're lying about me left and right. When the other side starts lying, it's cuz they know they're in trouble. But even mayors across the state have endorsed me. Six weeks ago, it was up in Dover, Morris County, the heart of the congressional district for my opponent. Mayor Jim Dodd endorsed me there. He's a Democrat. Four weeks ago, it was in Garfield, Bergen County, where the mayor there endorsed me. And when he got done endorsing me, he said, \"Oh, what the hell? I'm changing my party affiliation to Republican.\" >> Yeah. >> Two weeks ago, I was up in Granville in Sussex County where the mayor up there endorsed me. This is the sign. It's affirmation that people across this state have had it. Not just Republicans, independent, unaffiliate, moderate Democrats, too. People want change. >> The last thing they want is another four years of Bill Murphy for Murphy 2.0. >> The most fun we had though was back in Dover cuz we had that rally where the mayor endorsed me at a cafe restaurant. There were about 200 people there. In walked this woman at the cafe, not realizing what the hell she walked into. When she realized what she had done, she came over to me and she was a little defiant. She said to me, \"I want you to know something. Mikey Cheryl is my congresswoman. I really like the job she's doing representing me in Washington DC.\" And I said, \"Ma'am, that's why I'm here. You vote for me, I'll make sure she stays your congresswoman.\" >> Yeah. >> There was a pregnant pause and then she looked up me and said, \"I think I like you.\" I said, \"That's the whole point. >> That's the whole point.\" But there is great energy all up and down the state. What we're going to continue to do over the next 28 days on our way to victory is what we've been doing every single day since the day after the primary June 11th. We're telling the people in New Jersey who Mikey Cheryl really is. She wants you to think she's a Jersey girl. She's no Jersey girl. >> She wants you to think that she's a centrist, a moderate. >> Really? This is somebody who supported Joe Biden's open border policies, supported all of his inflation inflationary policies. This is somebody who voted no on the Lake and Riley Act. Let me see if I get this. You came here illegally. Crime number one. And while you're here, you broke the law. Crime number two, we're not going to detain and deport you. She voted no on that bill. She voted yes twice. This mother of two daughters to allow biological boys to participate in girls sports. That's one of those 8020 issues here in New Jersey. She supports sanctuary cities, us being a sanctuary state. This is somebody who broke federal law on stock trades and stock reporting for a congresswoman in the New York Times reports was trading defense stocks while sitting on the House Armed Services Committee. >> This is somebody who endorsed Mandami, the Socialist Democrat of New York and has endorsed her. >> This is somebody who voted no on the big beautiful bill. Let me see if I get this one. You're now allowed to deduct up to $40,000 of your property taxes on your federal tax return. The bill provides a magnificent tax credit for families with small children. Child care tax credit doesn't tax tips, overtime, or social security. Provides a magnificent tax credit for those who send their kids to private school. She voted no on that bill. Here's the problem. It's just like what they did with John Cororsine. They brought him here for Illinois. Didn't work out so well. They brought Phil Murphy here from Massachusetts. This hasn't worked out from so well. She's not from New Jersey. So, I got a really simple idea. How about we elect the Jersey guy? >> Jersey guy. >> The general have been here for 100 years. Three generations of generalities will all achieve their American dream right here in New Jersey. And that's what my candidacy is all about on your behalf. Now, fasten your seat belts cuz here's how it goes down for the next 28 days. If you get a flat tire on the way home today, it's President Trump's fault. There's nothing this woman won't blame on President Trump. >> And then what she's going to do for each of the next 28 days, she's going to remind you every single day that she's a woman. >> So Al Barles has asked me to remind all of you I'm a man. I just want you all to know. She's going to tell you she's a mother of four. I'll tell you I'm a father of four. She's going to tell you she's an attorney. I'll tell you I'm a CPA and a business owner. She's going to tell you she knows how to run a helicopter. Did you watch the first debate? It's clear this woman doesn't know a damn thing about running the state of New Jersey. She just does. Right. And so what we're going to do is talk about what we're going to do for the people of New Jersey when we win on day one. Executive order number one. No town in this state will be a sanctuary city and we will not be a sanctuary city. That only makes the job of our local law enforcement harder. Executive order number two, we're bringing back to work all of our state workers. Have you tried getting somebody on the phone? Phil Murphy's got them working from home post pandemic. Try getting somebody on the phone. Try getting your issue resolved. You know what I find embarrassing? You can walk into a DMV office today and walk out an hour later in Florida with your Real ID. Call for Real ID here in New Jersey. They're giving you an appointment in January. I find that embarrassing. These people work for us. They're coming back to work. Also on day one, I appoint an attorney general that supports both police and parents.  >> So, let's be more specific about that because one thing my opponent is short on is specifics. Okay? What does that mean exactly? We're getting rid of cashless bail. Cashless bail has created a professional criminal who's learned how to game the system. Talk to your local cops. Arrest, release, repeat is real. Let these men and women in blue do their job and keep our communities safe. Also, my attorney general will support parents. On day one, policy 5756 goes out the window. Under my administration, no longer will school districts be keeping secrets from parents. It's ultra. It's indecent. It's wrong. It's dangerous. No one keeping secrets from parents. On day one, we get a whole new state board of education. We'll get a the right public school curriculum back in our public schools. We're going to focus on critical life skills like reading, writing, and math, vocational training with an age appropriate curriculum in our schools. We'll get them back on track. Also, on day one, >> you'll get a whole new energy master plan. I'm never telling you what car you have to buy. We're getting rid of the EV mandate. I'm not telling you how to eat your home. I'm not telling you what appliance you have to buy. There'll be no wind farms off our Jersey shore. Here's the best part of that energy master plan. You ready? At the supermarket, you can have back your plastic bags. >> Mayor, you know, I can say I'm going to lower taxes. I get a nice round of applause. I say I'm bringing back the plastic bags. It brings down the house every single time. every single time. >> We will lower your monthly electric bill on day one by pulling out a regime. The regional greenhouse gas initiative is a carbon tax policy that has failed New Jersey. Air is no cleaner. Electricity is through the roof and 300 to$500 million in rateayer dollars are going to other states. We keep it right here in New Jersey. I can lower your electric bill bill on day one. Here's what my opponents put forth. an illegitimate plan that isn't feasible. She's going to declare a state of emergency on day one and freeze utility rates at an all-time high. We don't want them frozen here. We want them back here. >> Now, if you want to know how illegitimate her plan is, there are 77 incumbent Democratic legislators in the New Jersey state legislature. 52 are on the ballot this year. Not one of them has endorsed her plan. And even the governor, a member of her own party, went on TV and was asked about her plan. You know what he said? I don't think you can do that. It's illegal. We've gotten not a serious serious proposal out of her yet. And yet, look at what it is we're all up against after eight years of failure. We know what we're up against. So, this is why we so desperately need change. Also, on day one in my administration, my attorney general goes before the state supreme court with two new arguments that are long overdue. We're going to stop the overdevelopment of our suburban communities. It's time. It will also go before that state supreme court with a new argument for school funding. We need a fair school funding formula so we stop getting short changed in our suburban communities. And if by chance that Supreme Court doesn't agree with me, guess what your next governor gets to do? Two new Supreme Court state justice, one of which is the chief justice, and now I'm not appoint anybody that doesn't agree with us on this issue. So when people ask me why you're running for governor, I've already told you Chedarellis have been here for 100 years. I've already told you that three generations of Cheddarellis have all achieved their American dream. I don't want to be the governor of a state where an overwhelming number of people feel the state's heading the wrong direction. Two out of three are looking to leave. People don't feel confident today. Insecure if not fearful about getting the education of their dreams, job of their dreams, raising a family here, starting a business here, retiring here. These are all the things that people feel insecure about today. I would not be asking for your time, your energy, in some cases that you've written the check or your money unless I thought my leadership can change the way things are done here in New Jersey. When something I love is broken, I want to fix it. I believe that we can make a difference here in New Jersey and point it in a different direction and make this a state where people want to do all those things once again. We can do this. My grandfather started out, immigrated here, started out in the ditch as a labor for the water company, worked his way up, became a very successful independent contractor. That business had been sold by the time my dad was an adult. My dad came late in life, but my parents worked very hard. My mother worked midnights on the line for J&J. My dad worked in the street department for public service gas. But there were 10 years in which they owned a rest restaurant rest. My mom worked midnight. She ran the restaurant bar by day. Dad worked by day. He ran the restaurant bar by night. And every dime they made went to their four kids. The roof over our head, the meal on the table, clothes on our back, and our education. And they taught us each and every day that we would take care of each other. And we had a responsibility to our community, our state, and our country. never expect anything in return other than fulfillment of the American promise of opportunity. And then it was up to us to take advantage of that opportunity through hard work. We need to get back to that day. Look around crowd. Some of you can identify me. That was a time when you didn't have to worry about your kids walking to the bus stop in the morning. You didn't have to worry about what your kids were learning in school that day. Right? And when I grew up, if my parents got a phone call from any of the sisters at St. hands. One of my teachers or the cops, there was this thing at home called the wooden spoon. >> Yeah. >> One time my mother broke it on my brother and I was giggling. She went down, got another one, took it out on me. >> I was working the boardwalk this summer and there was a guy walking along with a t-shirt that said, \"I survived the wooden spoon.\" I went and got that vote. I went and got that vote. To my mother's credit, 411, not 100 pounds on a good day. My sister was a saint. My two brothers and I, the woman never once said, \"Wait till your father gets home.\" You could hear the drawer open in the kitchen. And now she came running. It was magnificent. And to this day, my parents inspired me. We got to get back to that day. And so, we got to make this happen. We're going to finish strong over the next 28 days, and we're going to win this race. Um,  back in 2021 when I came, how close did I come? >> How close? >> I'm still in therapy. Just kidding. I said that the other day in a town hall and the woman sitting in the front row looked at me and said, \"I'm so sorry.\" Just kidding. Men never say I'm sorry. It's always the women that say I'm sorry. We came out close to 21 with the wind in our face. That night with me at the top of the ballot, we had our most successful night in 34 years. We flipped 134 seats at the municipal county level, went in places we hadn't won in decades, 200 board of education seats, and eight seats in the state legislature. I think I was the only guy that lost that night. We got wind at our back this time around. And I'm telling you here and now, with that wind in our back, we can flip 13 seats in the state legislature. When we do that, guess what? We get to 41. What's 41? For the first time in 25 years, a Republican majority in our state legislature.  Let's get this done. Let's get it done. And so, I'm excited as we go around the state. People can feel the energy. I only have 2021 to compare this to when I really thought we were going to win, but this time the energy is off the charts and it's all across the state. But we do have to finish strong, right? championship teams finish strong. >> Right? So, there's a couple things I want you to know about me. First of all, you already know how fortunate we've been because of our hard work as business owners in this state. But the point I'm trying to make with the utmost humility is I don't need the job. I've already had some of the best titles one could have. Son, brother, husband, father. One day soon. Where's my daughter? Grandfather. One day soon. It's coming. I feel it. Anyway, those are the best titles, but I don't need the job. But make no mistake, on your behalf, on our behalf, I want this job. >> Leadership matters. This gets the statement we all love. I want to be in your level, too. You wouldn't be here. Number two, I'm not owned by any special interest. There are some very powerful special interests out there that own Phil Murphy, that own my opponent, >> and they're out there lying each and every day because they know we're going to win this thing. But I'm not owned by any special interest. Once your governors own, they're compromised. And once they're compromised, they can't get it done. But the third thing I want you to know is what's most important to me. Unlike governors on both sides of the aisle over the last 40 years, every one of them on both sides of the aisle has used this position to try to get to Washington DC. I've been asked to run for Congress. Answer has been, always will be no. I've been asked to run for US Senate. Answer has been, always will be no. Okay. Al Arles has not asked me to run for president, but the answer is no. >> And I don't want to write a book. I just want to write the >> So you don't have to worry about me losing my focus. My only ambition left in life is to fix the state that we all love. When this is all over, I'm going to the beach in Surf City. >> Okay? That's where you can find me cuz you don't have to worry about me getting this. >> All right. Then we got time for a few questions. Yes, sir. You brought up city places like are you going to come in and whatever. >> So the question is regard illegal immigration. I support the president. He has secured the border. Illegal crossings are down 98%. I support the president and anybody who came here illegally and has a history of criminality has to go back. I support the president and that anyone who came here illegally and has committed a crime or has been scamming our governmental assistance programs has to go back. Unless if you were violated by someone who was here illegally and we deport them to a nation that's not an ally, doesn't observe the rule of law, and doesn't incarcerate them upon return, was justice served? >> No. In those cases, we need to incarcerate because justice needs to be served. Listen, we're going to keep our community safe here in New Jersey. I appoint the attorney general. I appoint the 21 county prosecutors. You may not know this, but your local police chief does not report to the mayor. Your local police chief has a dotted line to the mayor. Your local police chief reports to the county prosecutors. And the 21 county prosecutors report to the attorney general. I appoint the 20 count 21 county prosecutors. I appoint the attorney general. They'll be on the same page with me and we will have safe communities in New Jersey once again. I promise. Thank you, Jack. And please, everyone, please share his response with all your friends, neighbors, etc. >> Like the one that we're not raising the sales tax. >> Yes, exactly. >> It's a big lie. >> It's a big lie. We said that at now what I found astonishing at the first debate is when the moderator said, \"Mr. Chedarelli, your opponent says you're raising the sales tax to 10%.\" We comment on this. I said, \"It's a blatant lie. She knows it. We're not raising the sales tax with a new school funding formula will lower the property tax and I will downsize our state government to afford a tax cut for individuals and businesses on the income tax side.\" And then they turned to her and said, \"What's your position on sales tax?\" And she said, \"I'm not going to commit myself to anything. Let me see if I get this. You get the lie about me, >> but over here you're not going to commit yourself to anything. Pretty typical. I think the translation of that is I'm going to raise taxes. Her translation, right? When she says I'm not going to commit myself to anything. So, yeah. Don't don't believe the lies. Yes, sir. >> We're going to do what? Listen, the cost of living has gone up New Jersey across the board in all respects. We're looking to get everything down if we possibly can. We're trying to make New Jersey more affordable. That comes to taxes. It comes to your utility bills, specific electricity. It comes to housing. And for families with very small kids, child care. Child care doesn't get enough attention these days of how much child care costs. We need to fix that, too. Yes, ma'am. >> I have two questions. >> Hold on. You You had your question. Let's be polite. >> I have two questions. I am not a fan of Murphy. I have no problem saying that. However, he is offering the 50% rebate of our taxes. This is the highest tax in the entire country. So, we are looking forward to the property tax $6,500. >> As a governor, I >> I support the continuence of that. >> There's only one aspect of it I do not support. >> What >> you can get that rebate up to making $500,000 a year. I think that's a bit too generous. >> So, for those who are making $500,000 a year, >> God bless you, right? >> But I'm going to take that money and send it other places. >> Okay. But the problem I have with that is there's a clause in there that says as long as the budget allows. >> Is that clause still going to be there by you? >> Well, they made that law so I have to live by that law. >> Okay. Well, you need to worry on the budget. Second second thing is I watch >> Let me say one thing about their rebate programs. >> Okay. >> I find it insulting. >> Now, the money they're sending you through the rebate, where did they get that money? They are famous for taking money out of your right hand pocket, >> putting some of it back in your lefthand pocket, giving it a fancy name, and then sending you about six weeks before the election. >> It's a manipulation. >> Oh, I know. I I get that. But but the at the end of the day, right, the governor really has no control of the property tax. It does fall back on the mayors. >> Uh, not true. >> Okay. I hope to God, you're right, but I've been through all this. >> Well, let me say this. The mayors catch all the >> for property taxes, >> right? >> But if look at your property tax bill, it has three portions, right? >> The least expensive is the municipal tax. >> The second least expensive is the county tax. And then anywhere from 50 to 70% is your school tax. And the reason why your school tax is so high is because your community is getting screwed with its fair share of state aid to your schools. The more state aid your school district gets, the less it has to tax. your tax is high because it gets very little state aid. >> All right. >> And so what we need is a new school funding formula. So your governor does have control over some of your property tax. >> Okay. Now my other my second question I know that went too long. My second question was this. I did watch your election the last time and you were winning all the way till 11:00. However, >> I was your governor for 5 hours and 43 minutes. >> So and I tried. However, when everybody went to sleep, NORC, Canden, Patterson, Trenton, >> let me ask you something. >> What are you doing? What are you doing with those four times? >> Did you go to sleep? >> I did. >> You I told you to take a nap in the afternoon and stay up all night. You were the reason why they walked. >> And I knew I said cuz I was down work every day. >> So, let me tell you what happened so you can rest assured that it wasn't stolen in 21. No, I want to know how much money you're pouring into these four towns because these four towns dictate how the rest of us live. >> Do you ever see how hard I worked to win this election? >> Yes, I >> Why would I not dot every eye and cross every tea to ensure a victory? Now, since you brought it up, let's talk about what happened in 21. >> Okay. >> Okay. Back in 2021 when this was the law, the county clerks were not allowed to start scanning the vote by mail ballots until after 8:00, which is when the polls close. >> Guess what happens when the polls close? All the results start coming in from municipalities. Right? >> What the clerk made the mistake of doing at 10:30 at night in Berg and Essex County is putting up the vote count. I beat Phil Murphy on election day in person on the machine voting. >> Right. >> They put up the vote count and they said 100% reporting. It was 100% of the in-person voting on election day. They hadn't counted the VBMs yet. >> You went to bed with me ahead. >> Guess what they started doing after you went to bed? They started scanning the VBMS. And then when you layered the VBM vote count on top of the in-person vote count, I beat him by 250,000 inerson voting. He beat me by 300,000 through the mail. So when you woke up in the morning, what looked like a 10,000 vote victory in Bergen County was a 10,000 vote loss. Here's the law change they made. >> And there's something else I want you to know to put you at ease. The VBMs can now start be getting counted at 6:00 at night on election day. So come 10:30, it's a true 100% reporting. >> Even in those four towns, because those are the four towns that >> Here's the other thing that you need to know that every single one of our counties has a board of elections. And on the board of elections sits an equal number of Republicans and Democrats whose job it is to oversee the counting of the votes. >> Right? >> So I didn't concede for 11 days in 2021 because it was that close. While we're waiting for all the votes to be counted, including all the provisional ballots, we looked into every purported allegation of fraud. Guys, no system is perfect. When 3 million votes are cast or five or 10,000 fraudulent votes, maybe. But I'm telling you that fraud is not what cost me the election in 21. You want to know what cost me an election? >> The 700,000 Republicans who stayed home because they didn't think I could win. >> Right. >> Guess what the election did? It was so close. It's now an eye opening experience. Cheddar was right. He can win. And they're coming out this time. We're going to win this.  >> Don't jinx me. Following up on the tolls question, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is a bystate agency. Governors Cuomo local Governor Murphy. Governor Murphy's been extremely quiet. So has his predecessors. There's a lot of waste going on in there. I've seen how aviation's direct expense budget was only half of their total expense budget because of all the indirect charges that the agency is doing. What are your plans for controlling the Port Authority of New North New Jersey? So, first let me say if I could wave my magic wand, this would take an act of Congress and I am going to ask our congressional delegation, both US senators and all 12 House members to begin this dialogue. If I could wave my magic wand, the port authority going forward would only consist of the bridges and tunnels that touch both states. New York can have LaGuardia and JFK. I want the Port Elizabeth and I want Airport, which are the two jewels in the crown that produce all the revenue. I'm going to try like hell to accomplish that. That's going to be a long shot. It needs an act of Congress, but I'm going to try to accomplish that. The other thing is I nothing gets done at the Port Authority unless I approve the monthly minutes. And I'm not approving a single monthly minutes unless we get our way with the Port Authority. >> Okay? We're going to stop getting short. We're going to stop getting short in a number of ways with New York. They go ahead with that congestion pricing plan. That's an egregious money grab on the backs of New Jerseyians. >> I got 400,000. We have 400,000 New Jerseyians that pay no income tax to us here. If you work in Manhattan, you pay your income tax to New York. That's our tax New York. You know what our tax in Pennsylvania is? You pay your income tax where you live. We get the short end of the stick on both sides of the two rivers. The point I'm trying to make is you're paying income tax to New York if you're one of 400,000. Did you buy a cup of coffee or bagel or lunch? Did you buy dinner if you worked late? How many of us go see a Broadway play? Do you know what we do for Manhattan in terms of economics? And now they're going to try and fix their subway system on our back. So here's how it go here's how it goes down. They go ahead with that plan. Any New York plate that comes through the tunnels or over the bridge in the morning to New Jersey congestion pricing fee and I'll fix New Jersey transit. Push around. And while we're at it, let me get one more thing off my chest. I'm landing in Newark airport recently coming back from campaign trip and the little the little screen in front of me that you watch the movie on. >> As I'm landing in New York, it says, \"Welcome to New York.\" >> So, I wonder when you land at JFK, does it say, \"Welcome to New Jersey.\" >> So, I'm going to have a little fun with you. We're going to win and I'm going to get sworn in and then I'm going to go up to my desk in the executive branch and the first thing I'm going to do I'm going to call the CEO of United Airlines and I'm going to remind him that he's a tenant of ours at the Port Authority. >> Yeah. >> Or the landlord. You know what that means? >> Yeah. >> And he better change that thing. When you land in New Jersey, it'll say welcome to New Jersey.  >> I'm not going to take your pension. That's what >> I'm not going to take. >> They're lying. >> What? >> So it's this is with regard to teachers. So first of all, it was never supposed to be a transgenerational plan the way social security works, right? So when we retire, who's paying for our social security? today's workers. The pension trust was never supposed to be like that. So, but having said that, we have a labor shortage in law enforcement and in teaching. People are not going in. I have to make sure the compensation program is compelling. Compensation programs comprised of three parts: salary, health benefits, and pension. And we're not making any changes. We need more people to go into it. But don't believe the teachers. I think it's shameful that an educational institution like NJA would lie to its members that I'm taking away their pension, which first of all is illegal. Okay, so it's a big lie. Don't you believe it? And the new ones are coming in, but I'll make the pension payment. But you know, while the state was making the full pension payment for the last 5 years, guess what they were not doing? Not funding the state healthcare plan, which is on the verge of collapse now. So you have cops, you have teachers, and state workers who are getting a 2, three, 4% increase in pay and going home with less take-home pay. >> That's right. because of the employee contribution portion of the healthcare which is going through the roof. The family plan just went from 52,000 to 69,000. That's a $17,000 increase. If you as an employee are responsible for one-third of the cost of healthcare, you've just lost another $6,000 in your net pay. So even when you get a two or three 4% increase, you're going home with less take-home pay. You don't pay the bills with gross pay. >> You pay the bills with net pay. So I got to fix the state healthcare money. But don't listen to the teachers. that the teachers that are retired will still go back there helping. >> Absolutely. Yes, that was the deal. That was made. That was the deal with me. But we got to get people to go into law enforcement teaching. >> No, you're not going back to work. Not going back to work. But what I would really like to do, and I I understand the woman, I'm not going to discontinue anchor. Not going to discontinue stay. Not going to discontinue freeze. But I like programs that are simple. The challenge with those property tax rebates is you still have to pay the increase in your property tax. >> Oh, yeah. And then you got to go down to town hall, fill out the application, wait 18 months to get your rebate. How about if we just freeze your property taxes once you hit 870 in the frozen? How about if we make all retirement taxree in New Jersey the way it is in Pennsylvania, right? How about if we don't reassess your home when you do a home improvement, right? >> How about we make the first two years out of high school, the first two years out of college taxfree so young people get a start here. How about if we cap property taxes at 1% of the assessed value of the home for the first 5 years of home ownership so young people can get a start here. Right? These are all the things that we could do to make New Jersey more affordable. Yes, sir. With the beard. >> Sorry, Mr. Chair. I actually emailed your campaign about this and I'm sure it was a staffer that answered back. >> Those damn staffers. >> But it's the answer was fine, but I know you pride yourself on giving direct answers to questions. No, >> it's pork roll. >> To piggy back off what you were just saying. Yeah. >> Taylor Hammer, North Jersey. >> Tomorrow when I'm in Salem County, it'll be pork roll. So, as you were just saying about the uh health benefits, I live here in town. I'm also police officer here in town. And uh my wife and I are both in public service. She's a teacher. So, what you're saying is 100% true. In January, we are having a third child and now I'm losing an extra $525 a month out of my pay. >> Wait, I want you to understand what you just said. 525 a month. Multiply that times 12. >> Okay, you're looking at close to, you know, it's more than $6,000 of net pay. He just lost net pay, >> right? >> So, my question is, how do you plan on fixing that? And are you going to stick to the same formula with chapter 78 in terms of police specifically paying a portion of the premium or are you going to set it to a defined contribution amount? >> No. Here's what I've said. The state healthc care plan is broken because of the employer. Now whether you know it or not, whether it's a state, it is the state healthcare plan, but many municipalities are in the plan. Many school districts are in the plan, many county governments are in the plan along with all the state workers and the teachers, right? And so if the employer, the state of New Jersey, screwed up the plan so badly, yes, >> that we now have this unbelievable spike, I have to reform Chapter 78 because you're not going home with less take-home pay. I think it's unfair to screw you because the state screwed up. So I have pledged to reform Chapter 78. So you cannot go home with less take-home pay than the year before. Sir, the best dressed guy in the house. If I known, I would have worn my tie. >> Mr. Celli, my name is David Bene. I am with Mont State News Lab. There's been a rise in unemployment. >> Are you a student there or an employee there? >> I'm a student there. >> Yeah, my son graduated from Montclair. >> Amazing. >> Yeah. >> I'm currently a senior. So, there's been a rise in unemployment, not just in New Jersey, but nationally for post-graduate college students. What what is your plan for tackling this issue in New Jersey specifically to ensure that not only jobs are created but sustainable in the long run? >> So New Jersey is known as one of the worst places in the country to do business. Why? Our business tax is now the highest in the nation 11.5 while the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania was lowering the business tax from 10 to 5% because he competes with Ohio whose business tax is zero. They were lowering the business tax in Pennsylvania from 10 to 5% 1% a year over 5year period. The Democrats in Trenton raised ours from 9 to 11 and a half. >> We're also known as one of the most regulatory intensive states in the country. Big business is also small business too getting concerned about the labor pool. You hear about people not being able to find new employees. That's because young people are finding greener pastures elsewhere. There's a dirty little secret about New Jersey. The we graduate not a bad job, our K through2 students, even though I want to get back to that. Okay. But those that go out of state to college, New Jersey leads the nation in the fewest kids that come back. >> That's why I want to make the first two years out of high school, the first two years of college taxfree to kind of incentivize you to come back and have housing for young people as well. But we need a labor pool. And the other thing we got to do is get our electric bills under control because what businesses are looking at today are taxes, regulations, labor pool, and energy. And we're starting to suck wind in all four. I'm determined to make New Jersey a better place to do business. I think that we could do that without screwing the consumer resident or doing irreparable harm to the environment. We make New Jersey one of the best places in the country to do business. We will grow the economy. That means more good paying jobs. People will live where they believe they can achieve the American dream. So if you believe you can get the job of your dreams here or start a business here, you're more inclined to be here. And these are some of the things that we need to do so we don't go through what we're going through right now. That's what it's all about. questions are so expensive. Is there anything to lower? >> So we have an affordability crisis in New Jersey because we face the highest overall tax burden in the country, right? And we also have an affordability crisis because of the cost of housing, now electricity, and also because of childare. When it comes to housing, we do need more affordable housing. We just have to be very, very smart about where we put it. We've got to change the economics of affordable housing. So, we shouldn't be overdeveloping suburbs, suburban communities where there's no mass transit, no infrastructure, no jobs, only putting more idling cars on the road. I like towns that have mass transit, bus lines and train lines. There's jobs in the town so people either have a very short commute or can walk to work, right? Downtown areas are famous for this kind of thing. And so we need more affordable housing and I'm going to work on that. There's a shortage across the state for 200,000 for veterans, disabled people, seniors, and young people. And I want to say something else about all the housing that has gone up about around New Jersey over the last 10 to 15 years. I think I mentioned this before. They're all rental units. >> Okay? In this country, you build equity with home ownership. You build wealth with business ownership. We want young people to have a skin in the game and build some equity. So we need to build more affordable housing in the right places, not in suburban community where there aren't those things that support highdensity housing and give them a lease to purchase option so they can own the place so they can start building some equity. Right? I think we're doing a young the next generation a real disservice with all this. But we need more affordable housing across the state of New Jersey. The reason why real estate is so high is because there's limited demand. You talk to any realtor today and the first thing they'll say is there's not enough inventory. When they say that, that means there's not enough houses for sale. So, you have more people looking for a house than you do pe right the houses are available. What does that do to the price? >> So, how do you get the price of something down? Build more of it. But I want to be smart about where we put it. And I'll go one step further on this. We got to get people to want to live in our major urban centers again. Our suburbs are beautiful, but they're not the engines of economic growth. Vibrant cities are vibrant cities. I got to get people who want to live in Newark again, in places like Trenton again, in places like Atlantic City again. How do you do that? Affordable housing, safe communities, good educational choices, and it will happen. Take a look at where Atlantic City and Las Vegas both were 50 years ago. Take a look at where Vegas is today and look at where Los Atlantic City is today. >> It's sad. It's sad. I think we have time for one or two more. Yes, ma'am. Question >> right right here. Uh oh. It always worries me when somebody reads a question from the phone. >> I'm sorry. I just >> will you support increased funding for the New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research to help advance life-saving discoveries and ensure New Jersey remains the leader in cancer research and care. >> So the question is, will you dedicate more money to cancer research? So we have a very very densely populated state with a very very high cancer rate. Right? And what we now have is something we didn't have before. We've got our major universities that are tied to large academic settings, right? So we have Robert Wood Johnson is part of and Ruckers, right, are part of the medical school in the south. We got Cooper. So we have these large institutions now that can do the clinical research to get to the bottom of these things. So the answer is yes. But it's also the job of the governor to make sure that our congressional delegation, two US senators and 12 house members work together to bring more money back to New Jersey. New Jersey is a donor state. What does that mean? If you add up all the federal income tax dollars that we send to Washington, it's way more than we get back. We've been a donor state for decades. That means we've been subsidizing other states for decades. We want more of that money back. And one form in which it should come back is medical research. >> Yes, ma'am. >> We heard the rally about Medicaid and the cuts that are coming down. As a parent of special needs child >> Yep. >> So this will be the last question before we have to go and do this exact same thing in Hudson County. Her question was specific to the the talk of Medicaid cuts, >> right? talk of Medicaid cuts and also the um are we going to take care of our most vulnerable population, those with intellectual disabilities and physical disabilities. The first job of any governor is to provide for the public health and safety. I promise you that no um um vulnerable population is going to be underserved in New Jersey under Governor Chedarelli. Somehow someway we will make sure they're taken care of. I promise you that. Second thing is with these Medicaid cuts that the other side is making a big deal out of. Okay, there's been two reforms in the big beautiful bill that don't necessarily cut Medicaid. Here's what they do. Now, you all know what Medicaid is, right? Healthcare for the poor and it's paid for for the rest of us and we are a brothers and sisters keeper. >> But here's what the president has done. The first thing he has done is said that if you're on Medicaid, you need to prove your eligibility twice a year. You need to verify your eligibility twice a year. Who put that rule in place? >> President Barack Obama. >> He made you verify your eligibility twice a year. The 45th president, Donald Trump, kept it there. Joe Biden, the 46, put it to once a year. Trump is putting it back to twice a year. I think that's fair. The other thing that Trump did is put something else in the bill. If you are abledbodied and your children are 15 years of age or older, to continue on your Medicaid, you got to provide 20 hours a week of volunteerism, education, or work. >> To continue on your Medicaid, >> I think that's fair. >> Why is he doing that? It's not to be mean. It's because billions are being wasted on people who are scamming the system. So what measures you put in to stop you there? And the rhetoric I'm hearing from the left, including my opponent on this, reminds me of when Bill Clinton",

Latinos preguntan la candidata democrata. Mikey Sherrill, responde. Mikey Sherrill, responde.\\ Speaker B: Thank you so much.\\ Speaker A: Aqui conoso trostiene treintas egundos para presentarse Antel audiencia.\\ Speaker B: Oh, gracias, josoy. Mikey Sherrill and I have a different kind of background, so I am going to be a different kind of governor. I'm a former Navy helicopter pilot, federal prosecutor, and now a current member of Congress representing New Jersey. And Jason and I are raising our four kids here in New Jersey and, and we want for them what probably all of you want for your kids. And so many people viewing today a great opportunity here in the Garden State. So that's why I have a plan to do just that to drive costs down on day one, I'm going to declare a state of emergency on utility costs, freezing rate hikes for families. I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting so we can make sure our small businesses thrive because they're really the lifeblood of so many of our communities. And we know that Jack Cittarelli does not have a plan. In fact, that's why Trump has called him 100% MAGA. Because Trump knows what we know, that Jack Cittarelli is never going to stand up to him. But I will always fight for New Jersey. So luciare por Nueva Jersey y gracias por suvoto. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Gracias. Candidata la primera pregunta esde Miguel Diaz Eleze origen dominicano lid del communitario.\\ Speaker B: Yeah, unfortunately, the Trump administration illegally gave over my private military records to Jack Cittarelli's campaign. As you heard, those records contain my Social Security number information on my 80 year old parents medical data. And we know that there were many reasons it shouldn't have been released. They didn't have a signature. In fact, a technician at the National Archives went into the VA website to pull out my Social Security number so he could get those records to illegally hand them to Jack Cittarelli's campaign. We have called for these records to be given back to us. He has refused. There is currently an investigation going on internally into how this happened. And we have the House Armed Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee and the oversight committee leadership there has all called for an investigation into this. And as of now, Jack Chadrelli has had no good response to this. And furthermore, when he didn't get, I guess, what he wanted from this release. He went after my husband who served in the military and has gone after other families, family members of mine who are currently serving in the military. So I have stood up to this, and I've told veterans from across the state who have come to me worried about their own data. And I've said, look, I can handle this. I'm a sitting member of Congress, but I'm going to make sure that nobody else has to go through this. And I think there's a real question on the table right now as to whether or not anyone could trust Jack Cittarelli in charge of personal data, because, remember, he would have access to driver's license information. He would have access to tax information. And we know that he is not somebody that is going to treat this information securely. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Politicas en la universidate Rutgers Latin Americanos, sabemos el peligro que representa una dictadura Segunda Presidential Washington, D.C. y Los Angeles Campo de para los teres destrantaria esabuzo del gobierno federal. Mucha gracias.\\ Speaker B: Thank you so much for the question and thank you so much for your studies. I think with your family's background, you know how important our democratic form of government is here. And I think we're really lucky to have young people like you who care so much about this country and this kind of government to study it and to really work hard for it. So thank you very much. So we have seen across the country Trump illegally deploying troops onto the streets of our cities, as you heard. And we've had the courts in California say this is illegal. It violates things called the Posse Comitatus act and violates things like the Insurrection act, because our troops should not be on the streets of our country. They are not here to fight American citizens. And the only time they should be used is in the case of an insurrection or a crisis. And that's not happening. And that's why I've been so against it, because I have served both in the military and at the U.S. attorney's office where I worked with law enforcement. And I can tell you that those missions are very different. Our troops are not designed to keep the peace. They're not designed for policing missions. Our law enforcement is, and that's why we utilize them except in cases of crisis. And that's why, as governor, should Trump try to deploy troops on our streets, I would be very posed to that. I'd immediately take him to court and demand that he stop this because I think it's illegal, and ensure that here in New Jersey, people are kept safe. It's also costing these states a lot of money because it makes our streets less safe, because these soldiers are not trained for this. You also brought up something that I think is really equally disturbing, and that's the recent meeting that Hegseth, our secretary of defense, had with our federal. With our military troops. He called military admirals and generals from across the. Across the world back to Quantico to address them. And he said things like. And the president said things like he would use our streets as training grounds for our military. I served in the military. I would never want to be on the streets of the United States using that as a training ground against American citizens. And I never thought I would have a commander in chief of this country that thought that way. So it's wholly inappropriate, and I would stand up against that. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Altos que nos otros.\\ Speaker B: That's a great question, and I hope you aren't moving out of New Jersey, but it is something I hear about all the time. In fact, from the first time I got into office, which was in 2018, I heard about property taxes. It's why I've been so opposed to the state and local tax deduction cap, because that prevents us from deducting our state taxes and working to drive these taxes down. And that's why I believe in shared services, making sure that some of the administrative costs, for example, in our schools, can be better utilized. We want our money going to our kids, to our teachers, to our buildings. But we have a bloated administrative system which is costing our towns a lot of money, which in turn goes to property taxes. The other big driver of property taxes is our state health benefits plan, and that is in what we've called a death spiral. And costs are going up 20, 30% each year for municipalities as they're trying to provide health care benefits to municipal workers. And so addressing the state health benefits plan, where I'll put in an independent auditor to claw back a lot of the money that comes back into the plan through insurance claims, claw that back to the state, and address some of the problems within the system so we can also drive down those property taxes. And again, this, I think, is a sharp difference between myself and Jack Cittarelli. He has voted to raise taxes at every level of government. In fact, I think the first time he voted to raise taxes on New Jerseyans was in 1990. That was when I was taking my first oath to the Constitution and That was a long time ago and he's continued that ever since. He's voted against over a billion dollars in property tax relief for New Jerseyans and has supported the president who has enacted more than $30 billion against $30 billion of tax relief in re upping the state and local tax deduction cap. So thank you so much for your question and I hope you raise your girls. I'm the oldest of three girls, so I love girl families even though I love my sons too. Thank you. Yes. So first of all, thank you for your service. I love women veterans and service. And so, yeah, certainly driving down costs for housing and rental prices is key. And so we've seen in New Jersey the cost of houses go up by 50% in the last five years and that's obviously making it difficult for anyone to purchase a house. And then people move into the rental market and all the rental prices have gone up. So I am going to do, I'm going to handle both. So I'm going to make sure that we increase that first time home buyers program so people can make that first down payment and get into home ownership, ensure that we are cutting through red tape and permitting costs so we can drive down the cost of building as we make sure we have more opportunity for people to rent and buy and then take on all of the landlords who are colluding to drive up prices. And again, I mean, I know I keep bringing it up, but this is another sharp difference between myself and Jack Cittarelli, who actually his biggest donor to his campaign is currently being investigated for illegally driving up some price fixing in apartment rentals. So thank you.\\ Speaker A: Gracias. Candidata la cigente Pregunta a lace Ilia Villanueva Quen reside en la ciudad Patterson.\\ Speaker B: Elvil so this is this campaign. I've told you that I have always heard from people in New Jersey that costs are too high, that taxes are too high, that property taxes are too high. But this feels different. I'm now hearing things from New Jerseyans like I can't breathe, I can't get my head above water. And I'm hearing the same thing you're hearing people deciding between paying their rent or paying for food, between paying for their prescriptions or buying food for their kids. These are the kinds of decisions that, you know, here in this state we should be able to do a lot better by citizens. And that's why, yes, as I look at all of the reasons the costs have gone up for electricity, all of the different agencies across New Jersey and Across the entire region that kicked the can down the road and then dumped the cost on families here in New Jersey. I said enough. On day one, I'm freezing rate hikes. But then I'm going to drive an energy arsenal into our state because all of the energy we produce in New Jersey will drive down costs. Because you might have heard of pjm, they operate the grid, they have mismanaged the market. And because Virginia has a bunch of data centers and is sucking tons of electricity out of the market right now, it's driving prices up everywhere. So producing power in New Jersey is going to drive costs down. So that's solar, the cheapest, cleanest type of power. That's battery storage to help get solar into the grid and help the grid manage solar and more solar in the grid, ensuring that our gas generation is modernized so it burns cleaner and so it produces more. And then we have a fourth site down in Salem where we can open up another nuclear power plant. We have one of only six preapprovals for nuclear in the entire nation. So building that out to drive more power into the grid and in this way having a long term plan to drive electricity costs down for New Jerseyans. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Muchasimas. Gracias. Candidata los Latinos preguntan Mike Sherrell Responde regretamos eno momentari.\\ Speaker B: Thank you. So as you may know, I served at the U.S. attorney's office as a federal prosecutor working on just that. Making sure we're driving down crime across our state. And that's why I prosecuted things like gun crimes as governor. I'm focused on making sure we have strong gun safety laws. We've seen attacks on our laws here in New Jersey at the federal level. So being nimble as a state to continue to have better gun safety right now we have things like ghost guns which are not always covered by laws. So making sure we have new laws to protect people here in the state. Also working hard on our policing. And so I've supported our police throughout my time in Congress with different efforts, including we had an outbreak, for example of auto thefts throughout my community. So ensuring that we have license plate readers so we can track those cars better and then working with violence interrupters on the streets so people can patrol the communities. And finally making sure we have mental health experts. It's called the Arrive Together program because in many cases our police don't have the skills or the training to help when people are suffering from mental health issues and that so many times leads to violence. And so having the Arrive Together program where police officers arrive with mental health experts who can also help create a more safe community for everyone in New Jersey. But, you know, as a mom of four kids, to know that there are communities where people don't feel safe letting their kids out of their homes or apartments is just something that I find unacceptable. So I will continue to work on public safety and thank you. Thank you. Thanks so much. It's a huge concern that I have. I was recently down in Camden, and Camden has historically been one of the poorest cities in our state. And I went to the federally qualified health center, and there was A woman there, Dr. Santana, who was wonderful. She grew up in Camden. She actually came there when she was, I think about 12 or 14. She didn't speak English, but she fought hard, got, you know, worked hard at school, was able to become a doctor because of different programs in place that helped her to do so and supported her. And then she came right back to Camden to help the people of that city that she loves. And because she understands the community, because she grew up there, she knew that when there was an epidemic of obesity and asthma, she couldn't tell parents, oh, just send your kid outside. Because she knew as a little girl, she couldn't play on the playground outside because it wasn't safe. So she started an online Zumba class so kids can get moving. That's the kind of doctor she is. And she told me, because of these cuts you're seeing to health care, because of the cuts to some of the grant programs to help people get education, she has said there will be no more doctors like me from Camden. And she said at CamCare, where they're working so hard to help stabilize the community, get kids more healthy, get the community more healthy. And it's been a real struggle, as you probably saw over the years, she said, all of these cuts are going to send us back. So instead of doing the preventative care, where children get checkups every year, where they can have their vaccines, where they can catch diseases, where families have the ability to go start, you know, when things are small, like a little ear infection, now families are going to be going back to the bad old days of emergency room care, where you're waiting until your kid gets really sick because you don't have the money, and then you take them to the emergency room, that is the most expensive type of care and the worst type of health care. That's how we get really bad outcomes. So communities get sicker and sicker. Kids miss more and more school, parents miss more and More work. This is exactly the opposite direction that we want to go. So that's why I've been talking to many of our medical care centers about what can we do if these cuts continue. So, first of all, I'm going to take the Trump administration to court and try to claw back as much federal funding as we can get, because, remember, as New Jerseyans, we pay $70 billion more to the federal government than we get returned to us. So we need to claw back as much federal money as we can. But then I've been talking about how can we get, for example, K through 12 students access to an annual checkup, access to annual vaccines, so start to figure out how we continue to push in, in new ways, health care for all of our families. Because let's face it, and you probably saw this, we were constantly, and we have been constantly trying to provide better care to families across the state, especially in some of our poorest, most vulnerable areas. And we've been doing better, but we still haven't been good enough. And now we're seeing that attacked. And so instead of just trying to get crumbs at the table, let's try to do something new so people have better access, that's more resilient. So that's what I'm fighting with the health care centers to do. As we both fight the federal government and the Trump administration, which is taking health care money away, education money away, trying to take vaccine money away, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, we are going to try to claw that money back and then also deliver new and innovative things so families can have better care than simply emergency room care. And thank you for all your work you've done. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Candidata hablemos agora de transporte publico Bernardette Menendez. Una joven abogada le prebunta. Buenas noche, senora. Shero Gracia porrestaraqui mi prometido. Yo somos usuarios frequentes del New Jersey transit. Este verano fuel amado el verano del infierno Puerto a las palas technicas y mecanicas que tuol sistema como usted. Pienza modernizar este sistema de transporte publico de Nueva Jersey.\\ Speaker B: I wish this was the only summer of hell. Unfortunately, this was about the third summer of hell. And in fact, this was related a lot to the path system. I'm not sure which system of transit you use. So over the years, we have seen summer of hell after summer of hell after Summer of hell. So there are a few things that I've done and that we need to continue to do. So the first thing was as Amtrak was not keeping its rail system up, because, remember, the New Jersey trains go on the federal train lines and they weren't keeping their lines up. So I fought for $300 million for Northeast Rail to fix the overhead wires, which were part of the problem for the last summer of hell. I am going to fight as governor to get more resources from the Port Authority. They split resources between New York and New Jersey, and sometimes I think New York gets a few more resources. So getting that into New Jersey to address the path system problems. The electric wiles wires in the tunnels were damaged in Superstorm Sandy. So we need to address that more quickly and get those fixed immediately. And then one of the big things that will make a huge difference in this area is the Gateway Tunnel project. So that is the biggest program of national significance in the country. It is the most resources this country has ever put into any infrastructure project in our history because it's necessary. Because the Hudson river rail tunnels are over 100 years old. They were damaged in Superstorm Sandy. It is the most used rail in the entire nation. We have about 200,000 New Jerseyans that take those, the rail under the tunnel every single day. And recently Trump said he was going to freeze this. He said he was going to freeze it because we were working on programs to make sure that all of the jobs, almost 100,000 jobs for our area were given out fairly into different communities and created that opportunity that I'm always talking about. But Trump didn't want that. So he said he's freezing it. Now. If he gets this done, that will cost New Jersey a million dollars a day. At first, it will only go up because of his tariff program. As building materials become more expensive as litigation starts, if we freeze this, because the workers will start to sue. So that is the really the worst use of money or resources we could see. And to have a president of the United States attacking the economy here, this region of the country produces 20% of the GDP of this nation. So to attack this economy, to attack the most important rail system, the most important infrastructure project, is madness. And furthermore, I will say my opponent just said, I think it was yesterday or the day before that. This is not a New Jersey problem. Well, I beg to differ. So do the 200,000 people that use that rail line. So does my husband, who goes into the city every day. And I can tell you, for those of you who don't these summers of hell, and maybe you unfortunately experienced it, mean that you can't get home for dinner if you have a child in daycare? And I remember this from when my kids were young. You're madly thinking, oh my gosh, oh my gosh, I gotta pick them up, I gotta pick them up. Right? And you're also, you know, you stop coaching your kids softball league, right? Because you just can't know that you're gonna get home. I remember years ago my husband tried to coach soccer and every Wednesday he was like, oh, guys, you know, can somebody, can somebody do it? I'm late, I'm late, I'm late. This is the kind of attack it really has on our families if we don't address this. Well, so again, I'll start by. I mean, I think we should be in court right now because this is, this is taxpayer dollars that the president is using in a political battle. And so get him in court right away. Get that money to work. Right now we have shovels in the ground. We are starting to see real movement. We have thousands of people employed and like I said, there will be almost 100,000 people total. So I'll do everything I can to continue this work and make sure that we end these summers of hell. I can't go so far as to promise a summer of heaven, but we are working towards it. So thank you very much.\\ Speaker A: Candidata nos vabos agora a la siente pregunta a la hace Diego Bartesay make the road New Jersey y confrequencias.\\ Speaker B: Yes. So I have always been for strong worker protections. I think these are really critical. And as we see the climate changing and hotter and hotter and hotter summers, we are going to have to act to protect people. I sat when I was first in Congress, I was on the Science, Space and Technology committee and I was the Environment subcommittee chairwoman. And that I don't know if you remember because it happened, we were just holding hearings on it, but that was when Portland, Oregon had a heat dome. So a town that was relatively cool usually suddenly had 100 degree heat. Nobody had air conditioning. It was very, very dangerous. So we are see unusual weather conditions continue all over the country. Several people died in Plainfield recently in one case because there were tornadoes coming through Plainfield, which was unusual. We haven't seen that before. But we are starting to see tornado alleys in certain areas of New Jersey. We're seeing wildfires. I mean, this is very unusual to have wildfires across New Jersey. Of course, the flooding that we're seeing. So in all these cases, as the weather is changing, we have to be at the forefront of reacting to it. And one of the key places we have to be is protecting people. And so exactly what you're talking about, making sure our workers who work outside are protected from, as we start to see some of these heat conditions that we're anticipating, making sure people have the appropriate amount of water and the appropriate amount of shade is going to be more and more important. So thank you.\\ Speaker A: Gracias. Candidata los latinos per guntan Mikey Sherrill responded. Regresamos in a moment. Immigrants Trust directive. El miedo a la policia es real estate.\\ Speaker B: Thank you. Yeah, we have seen ICE agents coming in here, as one police officer said, dressed like they are going to Afghanistan, covered face coverings and refusing to provide identification. That's why I'm on legislation in Washington to end that practice to make sure they're identifiable. And also I would bring that here to New Jersey. I'll also make sure that our police officers are keeping the public safe, making sure people can go to school, go to work safely, go to get their health care and their doctor's appointments safely, ensuring they can go to church and report crimes. That's how we keep our communities safe. And I have said from the start that here in New Jersey, I am going to make sure we are following the law and the Constitution. And right now we are seeing across the country people being less safe. We are seeing rollbacks in things like people who are here legally being detained and their families looking for them, American citizens having their rights rolled back. So I am going to be somebody that, of course, if you are breaking the law, if you are a violent criminal, I will hold you accountable. I'm a former federal prosecutor, but to see ICE agents pulling kids out of their homes naked and then separating them from their parents is unacceptable. So here in New Jersey, I'm going to demand, like I said, we follow the law, we follow the Constitution, people can be safe in their communities, including our immigrant communities, so that we can ensure that here in New Jersey people are kept safe. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: El Immigrants Trust Act.\\ Speaker B: So right now, I don't think moving forward with the Immigrant Trust act is a good idea. We have a court system that is a federal court system that is set up to go against many of the things that we want to propose or put forward. We have laws in the book right now. We have the governor's put orders in place that have been tested by a Republican judge and found to be legal. If we open up the courts again, if we pass new legislation and send it to the courts, not only do I think that that given what's happening at the courts and what's happening with our federal prosecutor's office, with Alina Habba illegally in the office right now, I think that would be undermined by the courts, and I think it could actually undermine legislation across the country.\\ Speaker A: Hola, una familia onesta.\\ Speaker B: So this is why I have always fought for comprehensive immigration reform, and I think it's what most people in this country want to see, Meaning we have secure borders, but we have a pathway to citizenship for people who are here, who are paying taxes for DACA recipients, for TPS recipients. And we were very, very close. And so even a very conservative member of the Senate had come along with Democrats. So we were ready to pass comprehensive immigration reform about a year ago. And Trump decided that he would rather have this as a political tool than actually solve the immigration problems that we're having in this country right now and decided to go forward with what he is doing right now. And right now, what he is doing is making people less safe, is costing our economy millions and millions of dollars. I was talking to the Mexican Chamber of Commerce, who was saying that $2 million in one day we lost at the port because of this. So that's why I am in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, which I am still going to push our federal delegation to do. But when we are here in our states, it's why I'm going to demand we follow the law and the Constitution. And in many cases, ICE is not following those things. So, for example, when they don't have warrants, when they are not treating children humanely, those are things I have a real problem with. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Gracias. Candidata momento de hablar de la educacion. Lisa Santiago le hacela pregunta buenas noches elemental in Jersey City. El distrito a pro vido eluso de celulares. El los salonis de classi se que los elulares son una distraction.\\ Speaker B: So thank you for all of your work, because given how long you've been a teacher and now an assistant principal, I know you went through Covid with our kids, and I have four kids who went through Covid here. And I know how hard that was on our teachers, but you were sort of the glue that kept many of our families together. So thank you very much. Yes, I would extend the cell phone ban. I have four kids, as I mentioned. Some of them can deal with electronic devices and some of them cannot. And so in too many cases, when our kids simply have their cell phones, they just don't have the discipline to focus and pay attention. And I do think this constant attachment to electronic devices is creating more anxiety and more mental health problems. And so on top of that, I really. I'm really going to work as governor to pass the Kids Online Safety Act. This was something that we had over 90 senators in favor of, but unfortunately, when Big Tech dumped a lot of money on Republicans in the House of Representatives, they killed the bill. So that's why it's up to the states now. And what this does is help make sure children are safe online, because we've heard really harrowing and horrible testimony from parents, for example, about the last thing some of their children saw before they died by suicide. It is really at a crisis point. If you talk to pediatricians across our state, it is creating really a mental health crisis in so many of our children. And we know the longer they are online, the worse their mental health can get. And so looking into how we're going to have a center of excellence because Big Tech has so much of the information, so we can address the algorithms so we can hold Big Tech accountable for some of the bad outcomes we are seeing in our children and make sure that we are addressing this crisis as well as putting more mental health support into our schools. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Definitiva mentes.\\ Speaker B: So I'm not. I'm not familiar exactly. Is this. Are you saying this has been passed or was this just proposed? They just passed it. Okay. I feel like it still isn't protecting domestic workers. Thank you. Yeah. So this is a large part of the reason I am so in favor of comprehensive immigration reform, because I feel like in too many cases, there's this underground economy where people are being taken advantage of and being threatened by employers with things like wage theft or not paying proper benefits. So certainly ensuring that the laws on the books are carried out. And I can think of several ways that we can make sure workers are aware of this, but that would also be in conjunction with community leaders to make sure we are getting the word out about what their rights are. Sometimes you see, like rights on the back of bathroom stalls, for example. So just making sure people are aware of all the rights. And we can continue to push that out throughout the community, throughout community advocates and trusted leaders, pastors, et cetera, to ensure that we're talking to community members about their rights and who they call to make sure that they can get access to help if they are facing those problems. And that's something, as governor, that I am happy to work to implement to make sure that all of our workers are properly taken care of. Yes, everyone will be welcome. I'm not sure we will have a great group of people and everyone will have a seat at the table. And I also want to just say something that's very important to me, is that my administration will look like New Jersey. Everybody here in New Jersey should have access to government and should be able to have access to advocate for the things that they most care about. And so that means at the commissioner level, but also throughout the administration, people who are making decisions will understand the communities because they will be part of the communities that we all serve. So thank you.\\ Speaker A: Gracias. Candidata los Latinos preguntan Michael Sherrill responded regreamos any moment.\\ Speaker B: So, yes, I'm very concerned, not just about that, but because of the current laws, fans from all over the world will feel welcome to come here to the United States. I've already spoken to people who are visitors to the United States on visas. They've been very concerned. They've been clearing things off their iPhones because they're afraid that their electronics are going to be taken at the airport or looked through. It feels like, you know, as a member of Congress, I've traveled all over the world. As a member of the military, I've traveled all over the world. And we secure our data because we assume in other parts of the world that people are trying to spy on our data. But to feel that way, to see that visitors to our country feel that way about coming here, is really hard to hear. And so I do worry about that very much. If people are going to feel comfortable attending and coming here and comfortable going to the games, as you suggested, and the fan zones, because, remember, a lot of people, most people actually won't actually go to the games. They'll be going to the fan zone, which we're going to be setting up all over, and different towns will have different activities. And so we want this to be the reason, I think, that New Jersey got the final game and Texas didn't is because New Jersey is more welcoming. New Jersey was seen as a place where people would feel more comfortable coming than Texas. And so I worry very much about how we are going to ensure that is the case. And that is something, as governor, I've already been working with FIFA on how are we going to make sure people feel comfortable. And then the other thing, as you mentioned is transportation. And so NJ Transit is working very hard to make sure that we can move people in and out because there will be no parking. I don't know how many of you go to MetLife Stadium. There's going to be no parking at MetLife Stadium. You're going to have to take public transportation and out. And they claim they've been practicing because remember this past summer they had the cup games, and so they were practicing moving everybody in and out. And they claim they can get them in and out, but I'm going to keep checking in with them and looking at the plans so that we can move people around so they have a really great experience. But do you play soccer? And which position? Left wing. Oh, left wing. Attack. Mijia is el centro. The center attack. Yeah. So it's muy. Did you play? I did. Pero cuando yo fe una hija. Soccer was new, muy nueva. So the coaches were the dads, and the dads played basketball and football and baseball. And then they tried to coach us to play soccer, so. So it was not at the same level. Our kids. Now my daughter is 13 and she is muy, muy bien. And I'm sure you are too, because.\\ Speaker A: And sus apatos aspirando a cergo venadora.\\ Speaker B: De Nueva Jersey como mujer que difficultades.\\ Speaker A: Hatenido and un mundo controlado po los hombres.\\ Speaker B: I am so happy to hear that you give me hope, because I will tell you, when I was a little girl, anything seemed possible in this country. And I was always told that if you grew up here, if it was like the 1970s, there was this idea that women were sort of on the rise and that you could achieve anything you set your mind to. So I tell people the story, because when I told my dad that I wanted to go into the Naval academy and to be a Navy helicopter pilot, or I said a Navy pilot. At the time, he told me he didn't know if women could go to the Naval Academy, and he didn't know if the Navy had women pilots. But because of the opportunity I knew this country could provide, I knew I could do it. But I'm so worried right now because of the attacks again and again and again, we see coming from the federal government, people like Hegseth, who is our completely incompetent secretary of defense, attacking women's service, among other things. I worry so much that women are feeling like, ugh, now I'll have no opportunities. So I love to hear that. And yes, there have been a lot of trials. And I. You know, serving in the Navy as a young woman, it wasn't easy. It wasn't always good. But I thought I was going to make it easier for people like you.\\ Speaker A: Gracias, Candida.\\ Speaker B: Don't see now. It's sad to see the rollbacks, but thank you. Keep up the hope and we'll keep up the fight. Thank you.\\ Speaker A: Sa.}",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 15 - Sherrill - NJSBA Hi, I'm Ray Penny with New Jersey School Board Association. I'd like to uh welcome We have a special uh two special programs. Both gubernatorial candidates have agreed to talk to the over 4,800 schoolboard members and charter school trustees in New Jersey about their views on education. So, this will be just focused on education. I think you'll really enjoy it. Uh and it gets you to hear our members and administrators can hear what the candidates feel on education. Hi, welcome to uh another edition of uh Education Matters. Uh I'm Ray Pine. I'll be your host. We've been interviewing the gubernatorial candidates. For this interview, I'm very uh pleased that we have uh Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl from the 11th district. Welcome, Mikey. How are you? >> I'm good. Thanks so much for having me. >> All right. Uh so first of all, thank you on behalf of the 4,800 school board members and charter school trustees in the state for them to hear your thoughts on education. So we'll get right to it. The first question, New Jersey is continually ranked one of the best education systems in the state. We're usually number one or two no matter what metrics you use. Um but you know, what will you do to keep us there or maybe even improve uh our rankings? Yeah. So, there's a couple things. Um, overall, making sure that every single kid in the state has access to a great public school education. I think that is something that has not only lifted so many people up, but also um really fuels the most competitive workforce in the nation, too. uh we have the most high-end workforce and I have had several companies who've actually left and come back because they could not find as well educated of a workforce as they do here in New Jersey. So, it's critical not only for the success of our students and our families that kids have access to great education, but it's also critical to our workforce. Um, and so I think uh one of the places I'd start is with third grade reading. are actually seeing some pretty bad results in many parts of the state and those scores. Um, kids who are not reading right now at third grade level and that's a critical inflection point for our students. If you can't read at grade level at third grade, then you have trouble going on in your social studies, history courses, um, science courses, etc. If you can't read the homework. So, making sure each kid has the resources they need um, so that they can achieve further success. and in doing so driving in stuff like highintensity tutoring which is an ev evidence-based particular type of tutoring that helps when students have uh have fallen off the track a little bit. We know from COVID we're still recovering with learning loss etc. And making sure we don't um kind of you know have students that have gone through maybe a rough patch in their academics. We don't want to just leave them behind. We want to make sure that we are getting the students the resources they need to be successful. high-intensity tutoring is such a great way to do that. And it also provides maybe an on-ramp to teaching uh for tutors who kind of come in and realize how much they love it and they can um get on the track to start teaching our kids as well. Um, and then I also want to make sure that we're looking at some of the county-based school systems to help address the historic segregation of our our state, but also some of our county based schools, our occupational schools or our STEM schools are some of the highest performing schools in the state. So, making sure we have those kind of nimble um uh high schools that can really help uh address the workforce of the future as well as we see AI and stuff like that. >> I'll get to AI in a minute. Um um school funding is always an issue and it's probably it is the biggest portion of the state budget. Um we have a funding uh system in place um that it's fully funded. uh not every single district is happy. What What are your thoughts on school funding? >> Yeah, so this is the first time that we've actually fully funded the school formula in this administration in in years really. And I think um it's important that we keep putting the resources in there because we have seen some slippage in our national results and making sure that our schools have the resources they need to perform well. Um and deferring some of the cost of running schools that each municipality faces. that can be really helpful if the funding formula has run well, but we need to modernize and stabilize it. And by that I mean um some of the formula hasn't been updated in several years and so looking at where students with disabilities are living. Um now it's sort of a one-sizefits-all, but really addressing some more individualized funding for those areas with higher than average uh students with disabilities. um areas that that have um some of the higher cost in education, but also stabilizing it because in too many cases these funding changes come in near the uh start of the school year and so suddenly right before schools are starting you see some cut to your funding and all of a sudden you're firing teachers or ending programs. So in that way too we need to stabilize it so there aren't wild swings year-over-year. >> Okay, I'm shift gears a little bit. um particularly since the pandemic social emotional uh learning and also looking at the mental health of our students has become very important and some say it leads to academic achievement. Is that going to be a focus of your uh school district as of your school district your administration as well? >> Um definitely this is a key part of my is going to be a key part of my administration. It's certainly a key part of what I'm campaigning on because I'll tell you as a mom of four kids, I have four three teenagers and a 20-year-old. And so, as you can imagine, um that age group has been hit incredibly hard. Certainly, COVID impacted them and and their socialization, their social emotional well-being. But then um even more impactful right now is the online um the online platforms that are such an everyday part of their lives that can be so incredibly damaging. So that's why as governor I'm going to pass the kids online safety act, making sure we are addressing age appropriate design code and holding big tech accountable for the mental harm that they are doing to so many of our kids right now, but also pushing in more mental health resources into our schools to help our students navigate this much better because it it's really it's really sad. I'll just tell you um in the past uh two weeks alone I have heard um um of two uh suicides of children um in that that we know the families and stuff. So, it's been that this is a this is a really really tough issue and um hearing from students at how what a poor impact the what goes on online has on their mental health and how the um design code and the algorithms move them into worse and worse places online and and actually any type of therapy or support system they have in place is undermined by the online activity. It's really um it's really so sad to hear. So, as governor, I'm going to to address this and like I said, starting with the kids online safety act. >> Well, I was going to get to this question later, but I think I'll do it now since it ties in directly what you say. Schools are grappling with the cell phones usage of students, uh how they should use it in school, if they should use it, should it be banned? Uh and also AI is coming on as an educational tool, but also that has, you know, there's a lot of issues with that. Since you you kind of touched on that, do you want to eliberate elaborate on, you know, your thoughts of AI and cell phones in schools? >> Yeah, and I'll be quick because I just noticed the time and I have to hop off in a few minutes, but um I'll let you, you know, I'd say, yeah, I'm for a cell phone ban in schools. Kids need a break. They need to focus on their learning. They need to focus on their social emotional wellness. And I think taking cell phones out of schools can really be helpful to that. >> Okay. Do I have one? I have one more question. >> You have one more. >> One more. Uh, diversity, equity, and inclusion is uh something that is uh Did I just lose? Okay, I thought I lost you. Diversity, equity, and inclusion is something that it's kind of a flash point for some people. Uh, it's better known as DEI. Some people feel it helps all the students uh particularly those that might uh be overlooked and some people feel it kind of plays uh the opposite. It plays favorites. So what are your thoughts on DEI and the schools? Um and how how do you look at as an administration? >> You know I think one of the strengths of our state and one of the reasons we have some of the most successful students in the nation is because we have students from all over the world. Um, it's because we have students from all different backgrounds and so it's incredibly important to me to find pathways to success for every student. We, you know, I do it because I think it's morally the right thing to do uh to to help drive opportunity. I also do it because I think it's the best uh economic thing I can do for our state is to provide this really strong workforce. And part of that and part of the understanding, we are not a state that is isolated. We're not sort of a backwater. We are a state that has power in the world. Um, and so the idea that, you know, the idea I think that that helps our students most is to give them a broad understanding of the world and a broad understanding of our history and our background. And in too many cases right now, the Trump administration is trying to whitewash that. So, for example, you know, clearing Jackie Robinson off the DoD websites or trying to act as if um some of the Civil War uh generals who attacked our nation, our democracy, and our country uh should be lifted up even though they committed treachery. I I think is just um really uh not what New Jerseyians want to see. I think in New Jersey, we want to hear about all the New Jerseyians that led to our success from every background. And I think that that diversity of thought is really important and that's important to me. >> Okay. Well, I'd like to thank Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl for joining us for, you know, a few minutes here to talk about her thoughts on education. Uh I hope you all enjoyed uh hearing from the congresswoman. Thank you. Well, >> thank you so much for having me and hope to see you soon. Thanks again.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 15 - Sherrill - Fox5NY Jersey governor. Attacks and accusations intensifying on both sides. While the latest poll today shows Representative Mikey Cheryl as the front runner, her challenger Jack Chidarelli not too far behind. >> Representative Mikey Cheryl joins us now with the latest news from her campaign. Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us. >> Thank you for having me. Less than three weeks to go and can we start by saying that this race has gotten so ugly and personal that it risks turning voters off when they say one of their top concerns is the price of utility bills. So, you've run on wanting to lower the prices. You're looking to replace a two-term Democratic governor. What went wrong under Governor Murphy with utility prices? >> Well, I think just about everyone kicked the can down the road. That's a favorite New Jersey pastime, unfortunately. and we're coming to the breaking point. So whether it's utility prices, housing, healthcare, long-term uh issues have not been addressed. And so here we have just about everyone, whether it's the grid operator, the utility companies, the administration um or the Bureau of Public Utilities, nobody has addressed this appropriately. And so at the end of the day when the rate hikes came from the grid operator which had totally mismanaged the grid PJM that cost was dumped on rateayers. So that's why I said look on day one I'm freezing rate hikes and forcing people to the table. I've already had an open letter from the public utilities to say they want to meet to discuss the rate hikes so we can come up with how we drive them down. And then there's other uh money coming into the Bureau of Public Utilities we can use to defay that cost as we drive in massive amounts of energy into our grid to defay the cost over time. >> All right, Congresswoman, your opponent narrowly lost four years ago, and it now appears New Jersey has really only gotten more purple in recent years. How do you appeal to independent voters in a race this tight? >> You know, I always run to appeal to all the voters. I find those issues that, as I say, are keeping people up at night. um if you're a mom or a dad or if you're trying to make it uh try to pay your bills, what is that thing that's really keeping you up that as governor I can do something about? And what I hear as I speak to thousands and thousands of New Jerseyians is that it's cost. It's utility cost, it's housing cost, it's health care costs at every single level. And so that's why I've taken an aggressive campaign to drive down cost. You heard about the utility costs. I'm going to really beef up the business action center, cutting through red tape and permitting. Just next door, we've seen Josh Shapiro cut through small business permitting times by 90%. That saves people time. It saves them money. It helps with the the lifeblood of our economy. But at the same time, I'm going to, you know, hold this administration accountable because the tariffs are raising costs on everybody. Everything from a cup of coffee in the morning to the grocery store prices you pay. And also the one big beautiful bill from a state like New Jersey which pays $70 billion more in federal taxes than we get returned. If the federal government is not going to run programs in education and healthcare, then they need to return that money to the state so that we can run those programs for people. >> You know, in the last debate, you gave the president an Fgrade when asked how he was doing so far. you know, how do you do that and still appeal to people who may have voted for President Trump but are open to a Democratic governor? >> Well, right now in New Jersey, even people who voted for President Trump or like President Trump are, I think, giving him an Fgrade on the economy >> because what I hear from from people across the state and including a lot of Republicans is this frustration with costs going up at every turn. I hear a lot of people, especially those independent voters, saying, \"Look, I I voted for him because I thought my costs are going to go down.\" But at this point with the tariffs and now freezing the gateway tunnel funding, which is, you know, that would be responsible for about a 100,000 jobs in the area, about 200,000 New Jerseyians take that tunnel into New York every day for jobs. You know, it's just at at every turn really hampering our economy, which as you know, the Northeast is responsible for about 20% of the nation's GDP. This is a really cool area to invest in, and when you take away those investments, you really imperil the entire economy of the United States of America. >> Congresswoman, the last debate got very heated with you accusing your opponent of profiting off the opioid crisis. Do you still stand behind what you said? Have you heard anything from Jack Shidelli's camp about a potential lawsuit? >> My opponent 100% profited off the opioid crisis. He did so by printing misinformation from opioid companies that opioids were safe. Uh he did it by working in tandem with them to develop a a platform so that people could get access to opioids. In fact, this is as a company that ended up paying over $4 billion in settlement fees for their wrongdoing was rolling out yet another opioid product working with Jack Chidarelli to develop an app so more people could gain access to that product as people um for example where I worked at the US attorney's office as a federal press where we were working to end pill mills and to hold doctors accountable. Jack was trying to help opioid companies subvert doctors to get more opioids out to people. Um, so he definitely profited from this to the tune of millions and millions of dollars and the people he was working for, the opioid companies were making billions of dollars and yet tens of thousands of New Jerseyians were dying. >> So, Congresswoman, have you heard anything about his camp in a potential lawsuit? We we know that you're doubling down on the claims. Have you heard anything? and now he's trying to walk it back I think because uh it was quite frankly it was a you know after he's been a perennial candidate. So after running on this his small business credits for about three times now as a governor's in a governor's race when I called him out on that business you know he immediately tried to shut the conversation down by threatening a lawsuit but he has yet to actually file and now it sounds like he's going to try to walk that back but we'll see. >> All right. Very well. We're going to have to leave it there. Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl, we appreciate you joining us. >> Thank you.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 15 - Ciattarelli - FoxBusiness So Jack, what do you want to say about this? You know, she doubled down on it again in a press conference. Here's what she said later. Watch. >> I think we've laid out the case that Jack is complicit with these opioid in lead with these opioid companies. I think he is right there with the people that again paid billions of dollars. So I think that the line is pretty clear. Well, Jack, I guess we're in, let's see what, you know, what sticks to the wall. Uh, now attacking you for claiming all of this. You're refuting it, obviously, and you have given the green light to your lawyers to file a defamation lawsuit against her. Fox Business reached out to Cheryl's camp for comment. We still don't have it. What do you want to say here, sir? >> It's a reckless lie. I filed a defamation suit. We're not letting her get away with that lie. And we found out in the last 48 hours that she took campaign contributions from the very companies that she's now condemning. Listen, Maria, this is a person who's based the entire campaign on a stack of lies about me, including raising the sales tax. I'm not raising any taxes. Her campaign is all about the disdain for Donald Trump and that she can fly a helicopter. None of that is going to fix New Jersey. Uh but we're not going to take this lie. And as I said, we're filing our defamation suit. Well, you make a lot of important points and people want to know what the policies are regarding taxes. I mean, if you look at some of the other blue states, uh, you add up the taxes I from federal to, you know, to state to to local like New York as well as New Jersey, you're talking about a significant tax burden. Are you going to cut taxes for citizens of New Jersey? >> Maria, we have to. I will reduce the size and cost of our state government. It took us 238 years to get to 36 billion state budget. In eight years, we've gone from 36 billion to 59 billion, a 64% increase. And nobody's better off. It's bloated. It's inefficient. It needs to be reduced in size and cost. And when I do that, I can afford a tax cut for businesses and individuals. New Jerseyians faced the highest overall tax burden in the country. We're ranked as one of the worst places in the country to do business. It's why people are leaving. The only way to grow the economy is to make New Jersey a better place to do business. I say we take somebody who's got business experience, an MBA CPA, who's put forth a very specific plan on how to do that. >> And of course, President Trump has talked about uh you and and has supported you. Tell me about the the electorate and how they feel about President Trump right now. >> They're very grateful for what he's done for New Jersey. He's put a temporary halt on the wind farms off the Jersey shore. Uh my opponent wants them there. I don't. I'll make that permanent the halt. Uh he's beaten up on the New York Democrats over their congestion pricing plan. That's an egregious money grab on the backs of New Jerseyians. And let's talk about what he did with the big beautiful bill. You now can deduct up to 40,000 of your property taxes on your federal tax return. It doubles the child care tax credit for families with young children. It doesn't tax tips overtime and social security and provides a magnificent tax credit for those who send their kids to private school. If your governor opts in, I will. My opponent won't because she's owned by the teachers union. All those things are very good for New Jersey and the sense I get is that New Jerseyians are grateful. >> Well, look, we also are watching this race in New York City and you've got speculation that uh Zoran Mani has taken money from foreigners for his campaign. Cheryl is facing her own heat for reportedly taking donations from a tycoon linked to the Chinese Communist Party. Fox Digital writes this. Uh Penny, the founder of Wang Zang America Corporation, donated $60,000 to the One Giant Leap Super PAC, which is backing Mikey Cheryl's campaign in the form of two checks in addition to giving her the $5,800 individual Max donation directly to Cheryl's campaign this summer, according to records reviewed by Fox News Digital and first reported by the New York Post. Now, Fox Business has also reached out to Cheryl's campaign on this, and we are waiting for a response. We have not gotten any answers to any of this, but we talk about the Communist Party of China all the time on this program. What do you know about the relation uh relationship between your opponent and the CCP? >> I know what you know because she won't answer any questions about it. But this is what happened in the debate last week. It was news of this. It was news of contributions from the opioid manufacturers. It was her being punished at the Naval Academy. It was her breaking federal law on stock trades and stock reporting. New York Times reports that while sitting on the House Armed Services Committee, she's trading defense stocks. I really think what happened last week, Maria, she cracked. And when she cracked, she got very reckless. And that reckless laid it led to that blatant lie that I filed my defamation suit about. >> Well, political analysts are pointing out the importance of this race and the outcome ahead of the 2026 midterms. Fox News contributor Liz Peak wrote about it in this Fox News digital oped. She's questioning will the Garden State voters throw out the politicians who've driven people to leave the state for greener pastures. Jack, your race is one of only two governor races this year, the others in Virginia. Tell us about the impact of your race on 2026 and the midterms. >> Maria, I get it. There's only two governor races in the country this year, as you said, and people talk about the implications heading into the Trump midterms of next year. There's only one implication I'm really worried about. the implications for New Jersey if my opponent were to win. She would be more of the same, only worse. We cannot afford another four years of Phil Murphy's failed policies. We just can't. So, I get it. I get the attention that this race is getting all around the country, but I'm just focused on the next 20 days doing everything I can to deliver a win. I really do believe we're going to win. I thought we were going to win in 21. I knew it'd be close, but there's something very different this time around. And again, the endorsements of prominent Democrats says something. >> Jack, you've got to get the electorate to come out. You've got to get moderates to come out and vote for you. What do you want to tell the moderates this morning to ensure that they're hearing your platform? >> Hey, if you want change, you have to make a change. The Democrats have controlled this legislature for 25 years. They've controlled the executive branch for the last eight years. We've got a property tax crisis. We've got a public education crisis. We have a public safety crisis. We've got an overdevelopment crisis. in our suburban communities. If you want change, you got to make a change. Here's your chance. >> All right, Jack. We'll be watching the race certainly and we so appreciate your leadership joining us this morning. Thank you, sir. >> Thank you, Maria. >> Jack Chitterelli joining us in New Jersey. We'll be right back.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 16 - Sherrill - njcom Yeah, I don't even want to tell you what my electric bill was this summer. It was horrible. We um have a uh very old house and um I love it. It's it's a great house, but it is a house that I'm constantly working to make more energy efficient. And um judging from the electricity bills this summer have fa I failed. Well, I'm declaring a state of emergency on day one and I'm freezing rate hikes. And I'm doing that for several reasons. Number one, because I am furious that as I trace back what's going on in the utility markets. This has been something that was foreseen and yet too many different organizations kick the can down the road and then suddenly put it all in the backs of the New Jersey rateayers. So, I'm really angry about that that that sort of mismanagement of our utilities um led to the rateayer paying for it and especially people who as I charted out just can't afford it right now. We have some money that comes in through BPU from Reggie and others that we can use to defay some of this. But in speaking to a lot of the people that work in this industry too, I think it's made people take like I I think it's made people sort of shake off the cobwebs to say, \"Oh yeah, we have a crisis and we can't kick the can down the road and we can't pretend it's not happening and we can't just hope it goes away. We all need to come to the table and deal with this.\" So housing costs have gone up tremendously. But you've also pointed something else out. We have um some of the most environmentally fragile places in our state because of climate change. The shore itself is um some of the most at risk from rising sea levels in the world. Um I'll also tell you and we have tons of river flooding. I've seen it in the Rawe, the Whippony, the Pacman, the Pake. Um, so we have all kinds of challenges, which is why we need to protect some of the wetlands and open spaces for community enjoyment, but we also need to build out housing infrastructure and so um, we need to have a statewide plan to do that and and that I think has been really lacking largely because of local control. So coming up with a statewide plan when you have five, you know, all all the municipalities weighing in, I I think has made it this environment where everybody is constantly litigating over it because there's no vision. And so it's a fight and what happens in too many cases is some mayor of some town will be really clever and they don't want some project. So, they zone it industrial and then five mayors later, some developer comes in and says, \"We're going to build a warehouse on this soccer field.\" And the mayor's like, \"No, you won't.\" And then they're like, \"It's zoned industrial. You know, you guys did this.\" So, I think a a broader vision. Um, and that's going to involve zoning help from the state. It's going to involve um not only developing and transit oriented development, repurposing some of this commercial development and building out on already built upon state so we can preserve open spaces. Um but also looking at some areas of the state which historically had been more dense like Trenton and Atlantic City which I think really could be thriving cities with some support from the state. And then at the same time looking at where we're going to build new neighborhoods as we think about the economy of South Jersey and how we're going to invest there and what transportation across the state's going to look like. And this is a statewide plan. This is okay. Here's a new transit hub that we're going to build out. A new neighborhood's going to be here. And it's, you know, going to be job opportunities to get here, here, and here. And this area is going to be um more open space, wetlands, um flooding prevention, etc. And we're going to have to we're going to have to get buy in. Um and I was just asked recently about the Glboro Camden line. And right now we have tons of opportunity. We have a lot of people who really want it. I mean, you know, connecting Rowan and Camden and the Eds and Meds corridor could be great for the economy, but then we have these groups that are really against it. And so, as governor, I'm going to bring everybody together and say, \"What is the problem here? What are you worried about? And here's the vision here and what it would look like and here's what we're committed to. And then let's get buy in from the area or an agreement that, you know, we're going to we're going to push in here, here, and here, and this is the way we're going to do it. We love this. We love this development. Here's why this development could harm wetlands. Let's But this kind of constant, we just fight and fight and fight and then somebody forces it and something happens. But it doesn't feel thoughtful and it doesn't feel and I doesn't just not feel like it. I can tell you 1,000% we're not getting the housing developed that we need. So, um, we, you know, as I've said in numerous occasions, uh, we have more municipalities than California and we have more school districts than municipalities. And we have school districts where they're just not even running a K through 12 program. So we really need to address the administrative fees because that's a key area where if you ask any parent, any family in this state, where do they want their money to go for schools? It's kids, right, and education, it's teachers, it's some of the old school buildings and infrastructure that we need. It's not this bloated administrative system. So, we really do need to um share services, consolidate some of these administrative systems. I'd also um I'm also going to address the state health benefits plan that so between schools and the state health benefits plan. That's where a lot of the costs are coming from for property taxes. And so, um we've seen the state health benefits plan go up by 20 30% a year. So, um, immediately getting an independent auditor in there to claw back some of the funding for the state, which is nobody knows, nobody's taking a look under the hood. That should save millions. But also then having more competition in the market, looking at the rules and regulations for Horizon, which sort of make it non-competitive in certain ways and and really making sure we're driving down costs and fixing the state health benefits plan. And then we also have um the municipal courts where we could share services there. I think that would be a key place too to see costs go down. Um, and that is all the property tax. And I think that's really different from my opponent who again and again just does not seem to be concerned with driving down taxes. He's voted to raise them at every level of government he's been in. Um, he's been supportive of Trump re-implementing the state and local tax deduction cap, which uh takes off the table about $30 billion in property tax relief. And he's even said stuff like, you know, I think people are willing to pay a little more taxes in their town. So, um, I'm going to drive those down. Well, I I think in energy, for example, in fact, uh, Murphy himself has has been on the other side of what I say I'm going to do. You know, I have built out this plan and it's not where he's gone. Um, I also think I have a very different background and come from a different place. So that this idea of having a culture shift in Trenton, having public servants who actually serve the public and cutting through the red tape and demanding that our public serve the public and and having the vision so everyone in government's working together and we don't have these kind of siloed cabinets um DCA, DOT, D working, you know, kind of in their own a lot of projects go through all of these places and we need to all be marching to the beat of the same drum. So that that's different. And I think what people are seeing because, you know, that kind of gets to the difficulty of running in the same political party as a two-term governor. And that's often been almost impossible here. But I think the difference here is people see, you know, Jack Chidarelli is a perennial candidate. He's running for the third time. He's brought no new ideas. And now his latest stickick is he's just going to do whatever Trump says. And so uh that I think has become more apparent each day. And now this gateway tunnel thing I think everybody's like even now you can't even come up. You can't even be your own man here. Um I think is having the effect of people seeing that he's actually the status quo candidate who won't bring change to the state. Whereas I think I've laid out a pretty strong platform of exactly how I am going to create change. So, I am going to um we are going to see third grade reading scores go up in my administration. Um that is just a key inflection point. And so, we see um if you can't read at grade level in the third grade, you're going to have a really hard time then being successful in your academic career. meaning in fourth grade you're going to have trouble reading your math and social studies and history assignments and you know as you go up science and health I mean it's just it it sort of snowballs from there which is why so many educators see that as kind of this key inflection point we know what works uh phonics space reading education which has that's actually how I learned to read but I'll tell you I have four kids and that's not what they were given to read and um uh for various reasons I had to help some of them learn to it was very very difficult. So uh so getting back to phonics based reading I know the state has some funding and and I want to make sure we have that so teachers can get that kind of training as we move into phonics based reading education. Um, also highintensity tutoring. So if a student needs extra support, that's a very particular evidence-based kind of tutoring that's tied to the school, that's a half an hour, three times a week, that's based on the school curriculum, same tutor each time. That kind of tutoring has shown really good results in getting kids back on track as well. I certainly uh would require um the MMR vaccines. uh you know if you look at the numbers of children dying from things like measles and mumps and rebel if you look at polio and to think that we had all but eradicated these diseases and now we're walking that back I just it's it's been 50 years we've been giving these vaccines and because of that hundreds of thousands of kids lives have been saved and it's not just the kids. It's when you go into schools and you're exposed to this and right now we are, you know, we are seeing across the country movement away from her immunity. I think some of these diseases, it's about 95. We're down at 93. I think we've already had 10 measles cases here in New Jersey. We're the most densely populated state in the nation. Imagine your mom or dad visiting you, your sen, you know, if they're seniors like mine are, and your kid comes home from school and gives them measles, mubella. I mean, imagine if um you have a baby who's too little to be vaccinated. I had four kids. So, a lot of times I had kids in school and I had newborn a newborn at home. Um, and you know, you you know, the baby dies because as we're seeing, I mean, we're seeing babies die across the country from whooping cough, pertasus. It's I mean, to think that we had all but eradicated this and we're going to walk that back based on RFK Jr. who seems to get a lot of his medical information from influencers on TikTok. I I just it's mindboggling to me. And so, uh yeah, we are going to make sure that kids are appropriately vaccinated to go to school.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 16 - Sherrill - HudsonRiverTunnel Thank you. Um, I really want to thank everybody who is here. Thank you to our county executive Craig Guy, Senator McCie, who we just heard from, Mayor Mandelle, Mayor Ganelli, Assemblyman Rodriguez, Councilwoman Trangali, Laborers, Vice President, Eastern Regional Manager Mike Helstrom, Jamie Morrison, and I think we just saw John Bartlett, Commissioner John Bartlett, who's been so instrumental in transit here, and I saw Sue Altman, who is here representing Senator Kim. So, it's wonderful to see this support as we fight for something so important to New Jersey as the Gateway Tunnel Project. Um, and I'll tell you, yes, I'm very proud, as you probably noticed, of that moniker, the tunnel obsessed congresswoman because this is something that I have fought for from day one. And we remember the battle days. We remember the first Trump administration when he held infrastructure week seemingly every single week and yet got nothing done and did not fund this project. So to get the federal share was such an accomplishment. And to see how this could so improve our region, especially after summer of hell after summer of hell after summer of hell. And so you also heard today what an impact this will have on quality of life. And look, that's why I'm running for governor, to fight for New Jerseyians, to make their lives better. And this project does just that. If we don't fund this project, if we continue to rely on two hundredyear-old tunnels, which were damaged further in Supertorm Sandy, I have been in them. I can tell you exactly why we need this tunnel in the most heavily traffked rail in the United States and an area of the country responsible for 20% of the nation's GDP. This is critical. This is critical and it's critical to the economy of the United States, but it's also critical to the men and women who commute every single day because without these improvements, it means continuing to miss dinner, to miss soccer games, to not be able to coach teams, to not get time with your family. It's a quality of life issue day after day after day. And really what I remember when my kids were young most uh anxietyinducing it means not getting home in time to pick your kid up from daycare and trying to figure out who can do that as you're madly trying to get home. So this is a huge quality of life issue which is the main reason I fight so hard for it. So look this tunnel project can be responsible for almost a 100,000 jobs in the region. That's what's at stake. If we see delays on this, it's a million dollars a day we'll be paying. And then should the president illegally be able to stop funding until we can clot back, then that is going to raise prices because his tariffs are raising cost on everything. And so once we get shovels back in the ground after any delay, the price will only go up. So that's why we're here today to remind people of how important this is to push back against this idea that we should in any way freeze it or that the president has the power to terminate it. And I think it's also worth noting that my opponent has given this president an A. That was after he said he was freezing the funds. He has said this isn't a New Jersey problem. Well, I'm sure the almost 200,000 New Jerseyians a day who take this tunnel would disagree with that assessment. He says he doesn't hear anything about it. Well, that's willful ignorance because I can tell you we are all talking about it because this is a huge economic impact and a quality of life impact. So, the choice is clear. I'm fighting for the people of New Jersey. He's fighting to excuse Trump. It's unacceptable. And that's why uh I will continue this fight to make sure I always focus on the people of New Jersey making their lives better and making our economy stronger. So thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to questions. Have you got any about whe >> we haven't gotten any more information, but the 18 billion would include Gateway and the the subway that he says he's terminating. >> So, I mean, that's rich, right? Because here is somebody who's tried to excuse it in every turn. Not till I've held him accountable and his backs basically to the wall that he gives this kind of milk toast. Oh yeah, I'll fight for it. In what way? In what way is he going to fight for it? He's not here today. He's not pledging it in front of the trade union. So I find it uh really interesting that the only time he fights for the people of New Jersey is when his backs to the wall and I hold him accountable. >> Congresswoman, the president says a lot of put a lot of initiatives out there. A lot of them were challenged in the court not and any no details on how he could do this saying that it's going to be terminated. He is the president, but how seriously do you take him saying that with no, you know, details about how it could happen. >> Well, I think this is why this race for governor is so important because in order to get good results for people, you have to fight back. You have to be willing to go toe-to-toe. You have to be willing to have your AG take him to court. My opponent has pledged never to take the administration to court. He said he agrees with everything the president does. So if we are going to back the president down from from this assertion, if we are going to make sure we receive those funds that Congress has allocated to us, then we got to fight for them. We can't take a back seat here. And so that's what strong leadership means in these times. And that's why this race for governor is so important here in New Jersey. question. >> No, I have not. process. >> Um, I would stabilize and modernize it, making sure we don't have the swings year-over-year and then modernize. We haven't updated the formula uh in many years now. So, I would modernize that as well for students with disabilities. Um, can we we'll just stick to on topic questions um until we get through those. He's saying he'll freeze funding. So the reason work is continuing now is because we still have some funding left. But once that runs out, uh which would be in a matter of months, then we start to pay a million dollars a day. We have a barge we're renting. We've got shovels in the ground. If we have this stop work order, it's going to cost us about a million a day. And that's until we start to get the lawsuits in for work delays. So it'll be very expensive uh should should he be able to carry this out. >> Congressman shut down. What is your expectation of leadership Congress that this is in fact a negotiating measure by the president in response to the termination of you know I I don't think a negotiating posture can be illegally taking money that Congress has appropriated. So shutdown or not, Congress needs to fight tooth and nail um because this is an area where they have acted and they should not give away power like this. Yeah, I mean I think you bring up a really good point. Uh Jack Chidarelli's voted against uh infrastructure funding about six times. he was there uh to support ending the Ark Tunnel project which we would have already almost been complete on that if not complete and uh he has also said that he's going to take a look at a lot of the transit lines and and cancel them. Um so we see somebody who's moving away from public transit. I am in favor of public transit especially in the state which so needs it for so many different reasons. Um, but I, you know, I think when you say what can be done, I mean, we've, we've basically allocated all the federal share in Congress. And so now we see an out-of-crol president just at his whim saying he's going to cancel it. We are going to stand up and fight for that because um he should have no path forward for that. And and this is what we're fighting for in this country right now is to make sure that we have a president who has to follow the law. When Congress acts as a branch of government and allocates this money, that should be the end of it. Um so we'll fight to get that money back. Is there anything you can do right now as a candidate or should the Murphy administration be doing right now going to court for instance? >> You know, um should as you've heard, he's made these bold statements. Um we need to see the actions and then I think we should immediately be in court to counter them. And I think that's why we're here today because to uh back the administration away from this, I think um I think there has to be an outcry so that people realize it's not going to go unnoticed. I think it's going to lose Jack the election. Uh and I I hope that says something about how this state is going to move forward and the demands we're going to make for this money. >> Question. When does the money run out? several months got >> I've heard three or four months. >> Yeah. I mean I we we've heard that uh Gateway Development Corporation probably has about 45 days of funding on hand right now. Um so but if they don't continue to get those reimbursements as they are scheduled to get um they'll run out of funding and the minute they run out of funding it puts this project in peril. Uh, and look, contracts have been signed already. And when in the construction business, when you're signing contractors with big general contractors who put a lot on the line from their own bonding capacity and the like and have really mobilized to start to do these projects, you're putting a lot at risk. We know we're putting at risk with the tunnel, but you're also putting massive long-term business ventures at risk as well. >> What does tell you You know, I I think right now we're all um looking to see how this would be enacted. There's, like I said, bold statements. There's not movement yet on exactly what this means in practice. >> President Governor Murphy has signal, you know, some sort of willingness to work with. Do you have that? I mean, you're you're going to fight and you know you are willing to sue the president over something like this but are you willing to also sit down and negotiate with him as >> you know I think if you are going to work with this president you have to come of a strong stance of advocating for your state and what you want to see and then you can negotiate I mean my opponent gives up before the negotiations start he starts from a position of whatever you want we'll do that's not leverage That's not negotiation. I I don't think there's anything that's a little more telling about the kind of power Jack Chidarelli would have with the president than the fact that 19 days until his election, the president's punched him in the face like this. That's pretty telling. >> The FDA described when I talked last year, they described a full agreement as a binding contract that can only be broken if one of the partners fails to What will Congress do the delegation do to enforce this contract? >> Well, I think we're um we're probably going to need the courts to enforce the contract. Um we're in the minority in Congress, so we will advocate strongly for it. We will bring on people as as many people as we can build out, but I think um the majority, the GOP majority in Congress has been largely unwilling to take on the president. So hopefully we could see some changes. But I also think uh that this would be something we'd fight out in court should he try to enact this. Thank you. Thank you all so much. I appreciate it. for this for 16 years.  >> I know. Hello. How are you? Yeah. I mean, look, I think you know this project being that the biggest United States  understand one project that's development of these um but they have a certain amount of reimbursement and they submit records back to the United States Department of Transportation. They get put back into their potentially taxpayers on the book because of the commitments made between the governors of states hundreds of millions of dollars billions of dollars billion9  billion force the minute you have contractually signific So, how do you build? We see it in 2008 in New York City when the recession happened. We seen building construction stopping. You see empty on the ground when you take out of the system and just freely threaten right now. There's still work that's going on on both sides of the river and in the media. But this development corporation development corporation only has a certain amount of funding on hand to get it through the next 30 days.  to bring down preliminary stage,",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 16 - Ciattarelli - NJcom So, the bill went from uh normally about $125 a month at the shore house uh to more than $250. And a lot of that has to do with the increase in electricity rates. And so, what I'll do on day one is pull us out of Reggie. The regional greenhouse gas initiative is a carbon tax policy. Uh half a billion dollars could be saved each year by pulling out a Reggie. The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is not in Reggie. Uh I think it's been a failure. Air is no cleaner. Electricity is only more expensive. And rateayer dollars are going to other states. Uh we're seven and a half years into this policy failure. I can pull this out on day one by executive order and save rateayers, homeowners, tenants, and businesses a half a billion dollars a year in uh in electricity charges. Uh my daughter just bought a home four weeks ago and um it wasn't easy. Uh people are over bidding. uh the ask price. Uh there's a shortage of housing in New Jersey, particularly affordable housing. What concerns me greatly is what we've seen the last 10 years is a whole lot of housing go up, but they're all rentals. I think we need to get back to owning the unit and we can come up with arrangements that make it a lease to purchase so young people afford the home. That's how you build equity in this country. I just want to see us build more affordable housing consistent with smart growth strategies. That means our major urban centers and our transit hubs. I live in one. Somerville. It's got a Raron Valley train line. It's got a New Jersey transit bus line. It's got jobs, a hospital, a county government, a court system, one mile of main street with mom and pop shops that all employ anywhere from 5 to 10 people. Um, that's where high density housing belongs, not out in the middle of nowhere. And I think the poster child for the failure of the current housing policy is the condemnation through eminent domain of a 175year-old family farm in Cranberry. To have to condemn a farm to build more highdensity housing in a community where there's no mass transit, no infrastructure, no jobs, only putting more idling cars on the road makes no sense. Number one, we need a new school funding formula. Uh I believe the current formula is unfair and uh it's nefarious. It's arbitrary. The state doesn't show us how the calculations are made. We're a more equitable distribution of state aid to our districts. We can lower property taxes in a great many districts all around the state. I think that we should make the first um I think that we should freeze property taxes once you hit age 70. Um we have a couple programs out there to get you a rebate, but you still have to pay the increase in property taxes and then wait 18 months for the rebate. Um, so I just want to freeze property tax at age 870. I think all property taxes for all New Jerseyians should be 100% deductible on their uh New Jersey tax return. And I think we should make all retirement income tax free that can help some of our seniors uh afford their property taxes. Uh so there's a number of things that we can do to lower property taxes. I'm for New Jersey. And so, um, I disagreed with the president on a number of his positions back when when he wanted to do offshore drilling. We don't want that, New Jersey. He didn't support the Gateway project. We are a donor state. We want federal funding for that important project and the like. This time around, he's been pretty good to New Jersey in a number of different ways. temporary halt on the wind farms beating up on New York Democrats over their congestion pricing plan uh which I oppose vehemently and certainly the big beautiful bill which quadrupled the salt deduction that's important in a state that has the highest property taxes in the nation. Uh we're going to improve our curriculum in two ways. We're getting back to basics and teaching critical life skills uh with an age appropriate curriculum and providing more vocational training opportunities because not all kids want or need to go to college. And where a child is behind grade level in the critical life skills, we're going to implement a high impact curriculum. Uh we've seen other states do this with great success. We need to get our children on grade level for things like reading, writing, and math. The data is pretty clear. If we do not, if they're not on grade level by the end of 8th grade, more than likely they'll be underemployed their entire life. Listen, my four children are vaccinated. I would suggest that people get vaccinated. We do have a medical exemption in New Jersey. We have a religious exemption in New Jersey. 16 other states have a philosophical exemption, including those controlled by Democratic legislatores legislators. Um, I think the Democrats agree with the current exemptions because they've controlled the Assembly, the Senate, and the executive branch for the past eight years and have done nothing to change that. So, um, I think what people are most concerned at is the volume of vaccines that are given in a very, very close period of time. And what I find a lot of people are looking for is not just informed consent, but the ability to stretch out the vaccination schedule if possible. A lot of parents are very concerned with the volume of vaccines given in a very short amount of time.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 17 - Sherrill - ITVNews  Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl joined ITV Gold for an exclusive interview where she discussed her key priorities and agenda for the upcoming November New Jersey Governor's race. Cheryl shared insights on strengthening the state's economy, improving education and healthc care access, and fostering bipartisan collaboration to support working families. Let's watch some highlights from the conversation with the full interview to be aired later on ITV Gold. Welcome and I am Pand. You are watching face to face right here on ITV Gold. Tonight we are joined by Congresswoman Mikey Cheryl, the Democratic nominee for governor of New Jersey. Uh, Navy helicopter pilot, former federal prosecutor and now a US representative Mikey Cheryl has built her career around service and leadership. and she's running for governor on a promise to make New Jersey more affordable, strengthen education, support small businesses, and ensure every community, including the vibrant South Asian community, has a voice in shaping the state's future. And Congresswoman Cheryl, I would like to welcome you and thank you for joining us. >> Oh my gosh, thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it. Okay, let's start with, you know, you said your top priority is making New Jersey more affordable for working families. So, what is the first major action you would take as governor to deliver real relief? >> Well, I'm going to get to work right away. So, on day one, I am declaring a state of emergency on utility costs and freezing rate hikes. I I really want people uh across the state to know that I have their back. That this is not something I'm going to focus on in 10 or five years. I'm doing it right away. I'm going to make sure that they are seeing the support that they need to see from government. So, I'll do that and then I'm going to go on to address cost in health care and housing as well. So taking on those landlords who are colluding to drive up prices, taking on PBMs or those middlemen um in pharmaceutical sales who are driving up costs for everyone sometimes up to 10 times and putting smallarmacies out of business. So in those ways in housing, healthcare, and utility costs, I'm going to get to work immediately driving down costs for people. >> All right. And you know, New Jersey's economy thrives on small uh businesses and many of them are run by immigrant families including South Asians. So my question to you is like how does your plan specifically support small business growth and innovation while keeping cost manageable? >> Well, as you know, um I'm going to both work to make it easier to own a small business. And uh I'll have um a more muscular business action center with a dashboard so you can see where your permitting is. You can have help with the permitting process. Right now it's very difficult to understand having a fasttrack team who can help walk you through the process, ensuring you can get better access to small business grants and loans. But at the same time the tariffs we are seeing coming from Washington have been devastating to so many businesses about a 50% tariff on goods from India and as we're coming up on Dvali to see um as people go out to try to buy the the food and the candles and the dresses and all the stuff that is only made in India to see these 50% cost increases is really hard on families. Uh the last time we saw each other was around Oakree Road as as we were talking to small businesses and the Patel Brothers grocery store was saying how it it was going to be a big hit to them these tariffs and we were all very worried because so many members of our Indian-American community were telling me that Patel brothers are just a staple of life for them um for you know the the food they go to to school with and their lunchbox. They were showing me some of the drinks that they had. Uh and then um the the different um produce and stuff that they work so hard to get. Well, they are telling me that now they're seeing the average cost of their goods go up by 40 to 50%. We're all seeing higher prices on groceries, but um especially when it comes to produce being imported um and all the tariffs being put on it. So you know since you're talking about tariffs which has really made like ripple effects on industries from manufacturing to retail. So tell me what different is your administration going to do about it? So, like I said, here in New Jersey, we're going to we're going to make sure that Trenton is doing everything it can to help small business owners to drive down the cost of opening up a small business, cut through red tape and permitting here in the state, drive down cost of electricity, which is so impactful on small businesses and their ability uh to meet their uh their costs. But I'm also going to I'm going to join the tariff lawsuit on day one. Right now, New Jersey is not a part of taking this administration to court on these tariffs. And really, I think many of them are put in place illegally, and we need to keep pushing to back this administration off of those tariffs. All right. So, you know, let's talk about education and opportunity. You have spoken about ensuring equal access to quality education regardless of zip code. What key changes do you believe can make New Jersey schools more equitable and better prepare students for the jobs of tomorrow? >> That's something I think about all of the time. I think a lot about our kids. I have four kids, uh, three teenagers and a 20-year-old. So, uh, our education system here in New Jersey, I I can see how important it is to our kids' ability to go on to get great opportunities to get a good job. So that's why I'm going to make sure first of all that we're addressing third grade reading. That is a real inflection point for students. If you can't read at grade level and third grade, you're going to have a really difficult time going on to further studies. Um so we're going to teach uh phonics education here. That's the best way you can teach uh reading. We're going to push in more uh highintensity tutoring. That's evidence-based tutoring that can help kids catch up. and we're seeing across the state that children have not caught up in the aftermath of COVID. So, we really want to address learning loss and third grade reading. I also um want to push in some county based school systems because some of our county-based high schools are our best performing schools. We can also create great opportunities there in things like occupational schools and STEM schools and create nimble schools because as you sort of alluded to >> the workforce of the future and the jobs of the future are going to be very very different especially with AI and quantum computing and um and making sure that our students are ready for that is going to be incredibly important. >> All right. So now the question that comes to my mind, you know, living in the state of New Jersey, property taxes, they remain one of the biggest burdens for New Jersey homeowners. So what specific reforms or partnerships would you pursue to bring real sustainable relief to families? So we're see you property taxes have gone up every single year and right now as the cost of everything has gone up. It's been particularly impactful on people on a fixed income. So certainly stabilizing property taxes for seniors is something I'm in favor of. Myo my opponent opposes that. Um giving property tax relief to seniors. I also want to uh have shared services part of this idea to do some of these county-based high schools can also take some of the financial burden off of towns. Um we also need to share things like municipal court systems and we have to address the state health benefits plan. That is the other way that um that t property taxes have gone up significantly because it's in a death spiral. So, I'm going to make sure that we address that to drive cost down. But my opponent, on the other hand, has voted at every level of government he serves to raise cost. He's voted against a billion dollar of property tax relief already. And he's supporting Trump in $30 billion of hits on property tax relief. So, he is definitely not focused on, I think, addressing one of the key costs that people face here, and that's property taxes. >> All right. So let's uh even talk about energy and utility costs. You know you have proposed declaring a state of emergency to freeze utility rate hikes. So how soon do you think you know families will feel the impact of that move you know once you are elected as the governor? >> Well the um rates are set to go up next year. So I'm going to freeze it so they don't do that. at the same time drive in a bunch of new power, solar, battery storage, making our gas power generation more efficient to generate more um and then at the same time look on a long-term path to nuclear because right now we are in an energy market uh in the region, the PJM region it's called. And some of the states in this region have very high power needs right now. Virginia has really invest in huge data centers. They're they're utilizing tons of power. So, it's made all of our rates go up. So, the energy we produce in state can make all of our rates go down, which is why I'm so focused on it. >> Okay. All right. So you know let's talk about the New Jersey is you know has lot of immigrant communities here and including of course a large South Asian population and I feel you know and I'm sure you also know that they face lot of uh you know hate crimes and bias incidents. So how will your administration build like trust, strength, safety and promote inclusion statewide? You know, that's something when I first um got at into the US attorney's office, I started work working with a lot of our local communities because it's really important that local communities know they can trust our police officers and law enforcement. But that takes a lot of community building. It takes a lot of outreach. It takes meetings so that people are culturally competent and aware of the different needs of the community. So certainly as governor, I'll make sure that we are working on that so that people know they can trust law enforcement. But other areas that I'm really focused on are things like the kids online safety act. We are seeing horrible hate going on online in in just about every single community and it's really creating horrible mental health outcomes on our children. We need age appropriate design code. I'm going to have a center of excellence to study this because right now big tech has so much access to information that we need. I'll also push in more um effort into schools and their mental health resources to help our children navigate this better. Um and help to stop the increase in bullying that we've seen because the stories I hear from my friends and what's happening to children online is is really unacceptable and creating I I think real fear among the community. I mean, it of course doesn't end in schools, which is why ensuring that we have state resources to protect houses of worship and communities, community centers, etc. to make sure they're more resilient because we're also seeing a lot of political attacks going on right now. And that is something um that as governor I'm going to work very hard to keep everyone safe. >> All right. And so my last question to you of course is South Asian voter engagement you know and the South Asian community is one of the most active and fastest growing voting blocks in New Jersey. So tell me how important is this community to your campaign and to the kind of administration you plan to lead? >> The South Asian community is incredibly important and incredibly vibrant. Um there are you know we have a lot of elected officials here in New Jersey. uh in fact the last time I was on um Indian TV it was with Raj Mccuri and so we know that they're they're such an influential important group so many of the small businesses a lot of the lifeblood of our economy the South Asians are at the heart of and the Indian-American community is at the heart of um so it's really important to me to ensure people have a seat at the table that I am reaching out to people throughout our state throughout the South Asian community to understand the needs needs of the community so I can better drive down costs, continue to help expand businesses. Some of the stories that I hear whenever whenever I'm with the South Asian community are really heartwarming because they sort of um emblem they're emblematic of the American dream. I hear stories of people coming here with three, four, five dollars in their part pocket and getting themselves through school and starting a business that helps thousands. Um, so making sure that we continue this innovative culture here so that everyone has access to opportunity is really important to me. >> You know, Congresswoman Cheryl, thank you so much for joining us and sharing your vision for New Jersey and we really appreciate your time and wish you all the best. >> Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate it. >> Thank you.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 18 - Sherrill - MontclairSpeech Montlair, New Jersey own Mikey Cheryl. >> Wow. Wow. This is amazing. I got to tell you, there is no better place to do a no kings rally than the People's Republic of Montlair. >> It is great to see everybody here. And you know, as I go up and down the state and we think about what this means, I hear again and again and again, I want to create opportunity for my friends, for my family, for my kids, for their kids. I want to make sure we all have a shot because this president is running a worldwide extortion racket and putting billions of dollars in his pocket. Not here, not in New Jersey. Because I got to tell you, at every step of the way, I have seen this country create opportunity. I've seen it on my mom's side of the family. You know what? My grandpa's family lost everything in the Great Depression. His dad lost his job. He lost his house. They moved back to the farm. And yet after the war, my grandpa got a good union job. >> And with that job, he was able to raise his eight kids. And when he got sick, he had benefits. He didn't put our family back into poverty. But it didn't end there because I saw it on my dad's side of the family. He grew up poor in West Virginia. By the time he was 13, both of his parents had died. And yet he was able to work hard and to put himself through college and he didn't have debt for decades. >> That's right. >> So he helped get my family into the middle class. But it didn't end there because I have seen it in my own life. When I went to my dad, I said, \"You know what?\" I was in the fifth grade. I said, \"I want to be a Navy pilot. I want to go to the Naval Academy.\" And you know what my dad said? He said, \"Mikey, I don't actually think the Naval Academy takes women.\" He said, \"I'm not sure if the Navy has women pilots.\" But I knew that in this country, we create opportunity. We don't shut it down. >> And so I graduated in the first class of women from the Naval Academy. on ships and oil. So even in my own life, I've seen opportunity. And I am telling you, and by the way, look around. There are thousands of people out here today. I am telling you that every single person here today has a story about how in this country their family had access to opportunity that they wouldn't have found anywhere else in the world or how they had opportunity that their mom or their grandma never would have dreamed of. That's what we've created. And it is so iconic to this country that we know it the world over as the American dream. >> That is what I'm fighting to preserve here in New Jersey. That is why I'm running for governor. And so I hear from people again and again. If I'm going to have access to opportunity, if I'm going to make it here, you've got to drive my cost down. And so that's why on day one, I'm declaring a state of emergency on utility costs. I'm freezing rate hikes on day one. And I hear from people it's too expensive housing rent rental prices. So I am going after people who are colluding to raise rental prices. I am going to open up brands for firsttime home buyers so you can create opportunity. You can create generational wealth for your families. I'm going to take on those PDMs, those middlemen, because people are telling me, Mikey, sometimes I can't pay for both my prescription drugs and my family's grocery bills. So, we're going to take on PBM, the middlemen, raising prescription drug costs so we can drive them down. So, whether it's utility costs, housing costs, healthcare costs, we are going to drive down costs here in New Jersey for families. But it doesn't end at the border of New Jersey because we know what's coming from Washington. We know at every level this president is raising costs on people. So whether it's that tariff regime where he's pocketing billions while the people of New Jersey pay higher cost on everything from the cup of coffee in the morning to the groceries in the afternoon at every level going up. Small businesses going out of business, big businesses not hiring. Or whether it's that one big beautiful bill. What is so beautiful? >> What is so beautiful about not providing food for hungry kids? >> That's not who we are. >> That's not New Jersey. >> And then saying he's going to terminate the Gateway Tunnel project. That could mean almost 100,000 jobs for families. That's how we create opportunity. Not cutting that out. So at every turn, we are facing a country where we in New Jersey are trying to open up opportunity. But we've got a guy in Washington DC that thinks he's going to reap all of the benefits of being in charge. We're going to fight it. >> We're going to fight it, stupid. >> Mom. >> So, I know the fact that you're here today means you have either voted >> or you have a plan to vote. Am I right? >> I thought so. >> And look around. We got a lot of people here. But we got to get more people out to go. >> So, I want each and every one of you to think about five people. >> Five people that you can check in with. >> Make sure they got a plan to vote. >> Make sure they have a ride to the polls if they need it. Make sure they know about early voting and where their polling place is. Make sure they are voting because together we are going to prove something >> because I want to tell you one final thing. New Jersey >> is not a red state. >> New Jersey is not a purple state. >> New Jersey is a blue state. >> So when we vote, we win. When we vote, we win. >> When we vote, Let's welcome. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. >> Great seeing you guys. >> Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey mighty Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey Mikey. When we vote, we win. >> When we vote, >> we win. >> Vote. >> Vote. >> When >> win.",

Wow. >> So, some of you have heard this before, but Wes Moore is my dad's favorite governor, and I am not convinced that when I win on November 4th that that is going to change. So here here's hoping. Here's hoping. But it is wonderful to be here today. And I'll tell you, you guys have been fired up. You've heard why this is important. But I'm just going to I'm going to kind of bottom line it right now as your closing speaker. >> So if you aren't fired up and ready to go, then then you haven't been listening. So I'm just going to I'm just going to trace out why we have to do this. I'm going to start with tariffs. >> I'm going to start with tariffs. Have any of you heard about the tariffs? >> Right. Have you noticed that everything from the cup of coffee that you drink in the morning to the groceries you buy to make dinner at night have gone up every single day. Has anybody noticed that? >> It's ridiculous. It's ridiculous. You know what I call this tariff plan? I call it a worldwide extortion racket >> because as we pay more, the president is pocketing billions of dollars. >> There you go. >> Yes. >> So on day one, I am going to join the lawsuit against these tariffs that states have engaged in. Do you want to know what Jack Chidarelli said? He said we should all take on a little bit of pain to support >> the president. >> No, >> I want to talk about something else here. Has anybody heard, and I think it's really misnamed, but has anybody heard about the one big beautiful bill? >> Taking away health care from kids. >> Taking away healthare. Taking away food support >> from children who are hungry. Uh-uh. >> Seniors, >> students with disabilities, adults with disabilities, >> not even funding innovation and medicine so we can create new jobs in the future. >> And guess what Jack said when he was asked about it? >> You know what he said? He gave the president an a.  Well, >> I don't think you'll all be surprised to hear that I gave the president an F.  >> I don't know if any of you have to go into the city or commute by bus or take public transportation, but the biggest program of national significance in the entire nation is the Gateway Tunnel. Mhm. >> And over 200,000 New Jerseyians take that every day to get to work. >> Yes. >> And the president of the United States said he was going to terminate it. >> That's almost a 100,000 jobs. And if we don't have that federal money, all the bus lines we want to open up, the microtransit that we're funding, that all becomes hard to do because we have a huge hole in our budget, >> that could cost us a million dollars a day when that funding dries up. >> And what did Jack Chidarelli say? >> You're going to love this one. He said, \"That's not a New Jersey problem.\" >> Whose problem is it? >> Man, that guy's out of touch. And so let's take it down a notch. Let's make it a little more granular here because we know what the fight is. As we see this president attacking vulnerable communities, running one of the most racist governments we've seen in our lifetimes. As we saw those young Republicans and those disgusting remarks. >> Is anybody surprised? >> I think we knew. >> I think we knew. So, as we see all of that, >> we here are fighting hard for all of our communities and when Jack Chidarelli was asked, \"Do black communities have a seat at the table? Do Latino communities have a seat at the table?\" Does anybody remember what he said? >> Next question. >> Next question, >> man. So, we know we know what the fight's about. >> We know that the future of all of our kids matters. >> We know who we support. >> And we heard a little bit about some of the ways in which we lift people up here in this state. We heard about how important the minimum wage is. >> Yeah, >> we heard about that. >> Jack Shinerelli didn't vote against the minimum wage one time. That's right. >> Two times he didn't vote against it three times. He didn't vote against it four times. He's voted against it five times.  >> So, I just wanted to lay it out for everyone here, but it sounds like everybody here kind of knows it, >> which I'm really glad to hear. So, that's important because you guys are the guys that I'm counting on to get the message out to everybody else. So getting on the doors, fighting for the things we care about. And here's the thing that we know and this is why your work is so important and why I appreciate you because what we know is that New Jersey is not a red state. >> No, we're blue. >> And I am sorry 32 BJ, I love you so much, but New Jersey is not a purple state. >> No, no, no.

    "transcript_text": "Oct 19 - Ciattarelli - GarfieldSpeech Speaker B: Now. Speaker A: The next governor is great state. Speaker B: I've never been more committed, never been more determined because of you. Never been more energized and never been more confident. We're winning this election. Now we've got 21 counties in the state. Every county plays a role in a statewide election. But know this. Something I've long known and won't say about Bergen County. Bergen county has a greater population than eight states and a road to statewide victory goes to word county. It is the fifth one of the top five counties, one of the top five towns in terms of population. This town matters. And I want to say something about as I go about law matters. Yes, we depend on our president for national security, national economy, international affairs. Yes, we depend on our governor for responses to natural disasters and public education infrastructure. But make no mistake, your daily quality of life in your town is dependent on the job your mayor does. And this guy doesn't damage. Speaker A: It. Speaker B: Is humbled and honored to have his endorsement. Now, last weekend I got endorsed by the mayor of Google. That's right in the middle of the congressional district to my opponent. He's a Democrat and now another Democrat has endorsed my candidacy. But this mayor's going a step further today. He's changing his party affiliation to Republican. So your next lieutenant governor James Dan the sheriff Morris county and I want to welcome your mayor to the right side of the aisle. I know one of things that excited your mayor so much is my choice for lieutenant governor. A 40 year decorated local law enforcement officer working to support the working men and women in blue. Now the press is going to ask you what do you think is it didn't let the mayor to convert to Republicans. Did the democrats think he made a choice? For the past seven and a half years every single policy has been a failure under the current administration. Policies that are supported by my opponent when I was housing. Look what's happening with the overdevelopment of our communities with regard to property taxes because of a flawed school funding formula with regard to public safety because they don't support law enforcement; with regard to the public education curriculum where we slip 2 to 12 on national report card. These are the failures of the current administration and that all changes on day one of our administration we take power. This is quite an easy decision for mayor but make no mistake changing parties is a very courageous decision. And we applaud you mayor for your courageousness. And I know what every assurance me and the next lieutenant governor on what it is that happens on day one of this administration. Executive order number one on day one no time to see if we sanction city we get an attorney general appointed by me that supports both our police and our parents when it comes to policing. That means getting rid of cashes bail. We got a special pupil to run that. Talk to your local cops about arrest release repeat. It's real. It's the warlock There's Dr. Be a consequence of breaking the law and there will be under my administration. Sen. Attorney general will also support me in getting rid of policy 5756 in our schools. The notion of school district keeping secrets from parents is immoral is day one. On day one of my administration will go before the supreme court and make a case for stopping all this over development in our suburban community. We'll make a case for new school funding so communities like this don't get their fair share of state funding for our school. And I really want our call for the resignation of all those that sit on the state board of education that have made all those offensive changes to our public school curriculum. We're getting back to basis they want to respect parents. This is what this election is all about. And I'll tell you what as I go around this state it's not just Republicans who are crying out for change. It's unappealling independent voters and, yes, even moderate Democrats who have come to the realization that this current administration has failed in New Jersey. Make no mistake, we cannot afford another four years of Phil Burton's Phil policy. Now, what I see the Democrats doing is something they've done before that has failed. John Coles and I came here from Illinois. That didn't work out so well. Phil Murphy came here from Massachusetts. That hasn't worked out so well. My opponent's not from New Jersey. So I got a really neat idea. How about we elect the Jersey guy? How about we elect the Jersey? I've been here my entire life. This is home. Always has been, always will. And you don't need to worry about me, get distracted, because I don't want to be Congressman. I don't want to be U.S. senator. I don't want to be president. I don't want to write a book. I just want to fix a state we all love. And you can't be fixed. So here's what we're going to do. Over the course of the next 62 days, Jim Gann and I, with the help your mayor and a whole lot of people in this room, are going to continue to go all around this state, 564 towns, 21 counties, north central South Virginia shore, and yes, all 600 diners. I've been to every one of them. Put them out there. We are going to carry our message up and down this state of how we go. Ralph Rickson, New Jersey. Now, fasten your seatbelt, because here's what my opponent's going to do for the next 62 days. If you get a flat tire on the way home tonight, she's going to blame it on President Trump. She's going to tell you in the next few days that she's a woman. The mayor is asking her to remind you that I'm a man. She's going to tell everybody she's a mother of four. I'll tell you I'm a father of four. She's going to tell you she's an attorney. Tell you I'm a cpa. She's going to tell you she knows how to run a helicopter. I'm going to tell you she doesn't know a damn thing about running. The state of New Jersey knows what the hell is going on. The Chedis have been here for 100 years. Three generations of Chedis have achieved their American dream right here in New Jersey. My grandfather worked his Way up out of the ditch. Became a very successful independent contractor. My parents were very successful restaurant bar. I could not have asked for two better parents. They were people of integrity, people with great work ethic. And they reminded my three siblings and me every single day of our responsibilities to each other, to our family, to our community, our state, our country. Told us never expect anything other return than America promise of opportunity. It was also in that house that my parents reminded my three siblings and I that in that house we had no rights. We got one right, age 18, the right to leave. My mother used a wooden spoon. I was working at Jersey Shore last week and I saw a guy, I had a T shirt, he said I survived a wooden spoon. I went and got that boat man. I went and got that door. I followed in my grandparents and parents footsteps and I'm a two time business owner here in the state. But along the way I've had the privilege of serving two general levels of council president in some county prior to integrator, two terms of sums of general, what we used to call the free opens. 32 year terms of the general assembly terming myself each and every time I know what's going on here in the state of Jersey, I'm not afraid to make the bold decisions to turn things around and even depend on me. I will not lose my focus. Each and every day we're going to roll up our sleeves and we're going to fix this damn for me. Young I asking you for the privilege to serve as your younger. But make no mistake, whether it's four or eight years, I'll give you all that I've got. When it's all over, I'm going to the Peach and Surf City. This is home. Always has been, always worthy. And I want to thank you all for being here today. Mayor, thank you for the endorsement, thank you for the great switch to Republican. It reminds me of something Ronald Reagan once said. I didn't leave the Democratic Party. It left me. And so together with your help, we'll get it done. 60, 62 days, all gas, no break. Let's get time. Let's get it done. You know what you think this campaign is? Speaker A: It's.",

    "transcript_text": "Oct 21 - Ciattarelli - FoxBusiness Let's ask him right now. Gubanatorial Republican candidate for New Jersey, Jack Chitterelli. Welcome, sir. This race is a nailbiter and this is your third attempt, for those who don't know, at running for governor. There's so many issues to tackle in the state of New Jersey. Taxes, the state economy, jobs, but the high cost of electricity is really what's become this critical talking point. What is your plan to bring those costs? I mean, New Jersey is 12th highest in the nation. to bring that cost down >> to do the opposite of what the current governor has done, Liz, and something my opponent has endorsed. Uh we got to reopen the plants that he shut down. I'll repurpose them and use them, use natural gas to generate more electricity. We'll expand our nuclear footprint down in South Jersey. Uh we'll build three or four new uh natural gas fired electricity generation plants. But first of all, on day one by executive order, I pull out a Reggie. The regional greenhouse gas initiative is a carbon tax policy that has failed New Jersey. Air is no cleaner. Electricity is only more expensive and rateayer dollars go in other states. We can save 300 to $500 million a year on day one for rateayers, homeowners, tenants, and businesses by pulling out a Reggie. The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania is not in Reggie. New Jersey shouldn't be either. >> It sounds like you are are um basically echoing what President Trump has said. He does not like green energy projects. But my question is, and we we've covered this extensively, the state of Texas, 50% of its energy demands are now being fed by alternative energy and subgreen energy. So why wouldn't you check all the boxes, do all of the above? Because there is such incredible demand right now for you for electricity. >> Uh Liz, I hope you're not going to do what my opponent does by comparing us to Texas. My goodness, it's 30 times the size of New Jersey with sun that shines 12 months a year. Listen, we need a rational transition to the future. I'm not writing off solar. I think all the warehousing that's gone up is prime real estate for solar arrays on the rooftops. That's not a nimi issue. The warehouse is already there. My DP will accelerate solar on the rooftops of warehouses. We'll take an allabove approach. But make no mistake, in that all the above approach, we're not going to have wind farms off our Jersey shore. Let me ask you this about the demand side of it. Basically, if you look at what is soaking up most of the demand, much of what residents do, and I'm a New Jersey resident, hasn't really changed that much. But the sprouting up of these AI data centers, they are huge gulpers of this and large-scale data centers, the growth in electricity usage from them, and that includes New Jersey, is a major factor. I mean as experts estimate data centers alone could account for something like 70% of the projected demand increase. Can you give me a sense of how you sort of skate just on the edge here of wanting to stimulate the AI buildout because that's great for the economy but also make sure that they shoulder the cost of what they are drinking. Liz, the vast majority of data centers that have been proposed from New Jersey have been rejected because we don't have the juice. And the reason we don't have the juice is because Phil Murphy shut down six different electricity generation plants. Put a moratorium on the currently existing natural gas fired electricity generation plants. Didn't expand solar in South Jersey. Didn't accelerate he didn't expand nuclear rather in South Jersey and didn't accelerate solar. He bet it all on wind. Fact of the matter is Pennsylvania is kicking our butt when it comes to data center development. That's an economic development opportunity in terms of the construction operations. So when Phil Murphy took office, we were an electricity exporter. Today we have to import our electricity. That's why we've got a shortage. It's why people are paying through the notes. >> You received an endorsement from President Trump and uh that is I'm sure from your perspective really good. But it was just earlier this month that the Trump administration froze federal funding as part of the government shutdown. Certainly that project, the gateway tunnel, the Hudson Gateway tunnel between New York and New Jersey. This would have been billions of dollars in federal spending, but it would certainly have connected so much of New Jersey and shaken out a lot of the traffic that is there. How do you how do you feel about that, >> Liz? The Gateway project is managed by the Gateway Commission. The Gateway Commission is flushed with cash. The government shutdown would have to continue for another two months before that project would come to a halt. I believe the shutdown will be over by then. I think the president is just playing some real hard ball tactics with the Democrats by saying he's going to shut down the Gateway project. It's the quintessential federal infrastructure project. It's not being shut down. With me as governor and my relationship with the president, hell or high water, we'll get the Gateway project done. >> Good to hear. All right. Uh Jack Chidarelli, it's great to have you on the show. Thank you so much for joining us.",
